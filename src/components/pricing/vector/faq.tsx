        <AccordionContent>
          The storage cost is charged at a rate of $0.25 per GB total storage.
          Even if you do not access your data, we have to keep it persistent in
          Cloud Providerâ€™s block storage (eg AWS EBS, S3) for durability. To
          calculate the total storage cost, we take daily average of your data
          size and multiply with $0.25 at the end of the month. For instance, if
          you have 1 GB data in your index throughout month, you will pay $0.25.
