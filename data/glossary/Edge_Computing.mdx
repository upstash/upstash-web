Edge computing brings computation and data storage closer to the location where it is needed, reducing latency and improving response times. It is especially useful for serverless applications that require low-latency access to data.

### Edge Computing Advantages
- **Reduced Latency**: Data processing closer to the source.
- **Enhanced Performance**: Faster response times.
