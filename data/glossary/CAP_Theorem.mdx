CAP Theorem states that a distributed system can guarantee only two of three properties: Consistency, Availability, and Partition Tolerance. In the face of network partitioning, a system can either remain available with potentially stale data or maintain consistency by limiting availability.

### Components of CAP Theorem
- **Consistency**: Ensures all nodes have the same data at the same time.
- **Availability**: Ensures the system responds to all requests.
- **Partition Tolerance**: Continues functioning even if communication between parts of the system is lost.
