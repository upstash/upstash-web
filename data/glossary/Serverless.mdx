Serverless is a cloud computing model where the cloud provider automatically manages the infrastructure, scaling resources as needed. With serverless, developers focus on writing code without managing servers or infrastructure, paying only for the compute time used, making it a cost-efficient model for scalable applications.

### Key Benefits of Serverless
- **Scalability**: Automatically scales based on demand.
- **Cost Efficiency**: Pay only for the resources used.
- **Reduced Management**: No need for server management or maintenance.
