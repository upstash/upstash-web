A message queue is a form of asynchronous communication protocol where messages are sent and stored until they can be processed by the receiving service. It decouples the sender and receiver, enabling smooth handling of messages even under heavy loads.

### Message Queue Benefits
- **Decoupling**: Separates sender and receiver, allowing independent operation.
- **Reliability**: Ensures messages are retained until acknowledged.
