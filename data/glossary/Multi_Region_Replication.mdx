Multi-region replication involves storing copies of data across multiple geographic locations to improve access speed and redundancy. This approach ensures data availability and improves fault tolerance.

### Benefits of Multi-Region Replication
- **Redundancy**: Protects against data loss.
- **Improved Access**: Faster data retrieval for users in different regions.
