Rate limiting is a technique used to control the rate at which requests are made to a system to prevent overloading or abuse. By setting request limits, systems can maintain availability and protect against abuse.

### Types of Rate Limiting
- **Fixed Window**: Limits are reset at fixed intervals.
- **Sliding Window**: Adjusts limits based on ongoing traffic patterns.
