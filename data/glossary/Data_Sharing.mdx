Data sharding is a database partitioning technique that splits large databases into smaller, more manageable parts, called shards, which are distributed across multiple servers to improve performance and scalability.

### Benefits of Data Sharding
- **Improved Performance**: Reduces load on individual database instances.
- **Scalability**: Allows the system to handle growing datasets.
