This page describes the steps on how to create a database on the Upstash and
connect it with a Redis client.

## Create a Database

Once you logged in, you can create a database by clicking on the plus sign at
the top right corner.

<img className="ss" src="/img/getting_started/create.png" width="520" />

**Database Name:** Type a name for your database.

**Region:** Select the region where your database will run. For best
performance, choose the Region which your applications are closer to. We are
planning to support other regions and cloud providers. Please send your requests
to [feedback@upstash.com](mailto:feedback@upstash.com) to expedite it.

Once you click on Create button, you should see your cluster up and running as
below:

## Connect to Your Database

You can connect to your database with any Redis client. For simplicity, we will
use `redis-cli` tool in this guide but please refer
to [Connect Your Client](../howto/connectclient.md) section for more about
connecting via Redis clients.

`redis-cli` comes packaged with the official Redis distribution. If you do not
have Redis installed, you can get it as described
at <a href="https://redis.io/topics/quickstart" target="_blank">Redis Quick
Start</a>
document. Now, you can connect to and run commands on your database as below:

```bash
redis-cli -a PASSWORD -h ENDPOINT -p PORT
# Warning: Using a password with '-a' or '-u' option on the command line interface may not be safe.
ENDPOINT:PORT> set counter 0
# OK
ENDPOINT:PORT> get counter
# "0"
ENDPOINT:PORT> incr counter
# (integer) 1
ENDPOINT:PORT> incr counter
# (integer) 2
```

Now you will start to see some action on the charts. Please go
to [Metrics and Charts](../howto/metricsandcharts.md) section for detailed
information about metrics and charts. Note that charts are updated every 10
seconds.

Congratulations! You have created your first database with Upstash.
