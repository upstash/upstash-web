As a full-stack web framework, [Remix](https://remix.run/) provides APIs to deal with common web server use cases. This post will focus on sessions and why and how you can use Upstash to store them.

## What is a session?

> The Remix docs have a very good introduction to sessions: https://remix.run/docs/en/v1/api/remix#sessions

In a few words, sessions are a mechanism that allows the server and the client to share user data/state. Examples of session uses are tracking user authentication state, shopping cart status, flash messages, etc.

## Why use Upstash Redis?

Session data is stored on the server. When deploying to serverless infrastructure or some PaaS infrastructure (e.g., Heroku), you cannot persist the data on the server's file system as it may change on every request (serverless) or deployment (PaaS). To persist the data, you should store the users' data on an external database. Upstash Redis DB is a great solution for storing session data for the following reasons:

- Similar to Redis, sessions by nature have a `key:value` data structure where the key is the id of the session, and the value is its serialized data.
- Redis has a built-in expiry mechanism that reduces the need to clean up expired sessions.
- Sessions may hold sensitive user data, and Upstash Redis encrypts all its stored data.
- Upstash uses a simple HTTP REST API. HTTP is the easiest way to communicate from a serverless infrastructure.

## How to use Upstash as a session provider in Redis

> This post is based on the [Redis Session Storage Using Upstash Example](https://github.com/remix-run/remix/tree/main/examples/redis-upstash-session) I wrote. Feel free to clone the Remix repo and give it a go.

### Step 1 - Get your Upstash API keys

- Go to https://upstash.com/ and create a new account
- Create a new Redis DB
- Copy the `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL` & `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN` and store them in a file called `.env` in the root of your Remix project.
- Install `dotenv` - `$ npm install --save-dev dotenv` - This will allow you to inject your environment variables from the `.env` file you just created.
- Go to your `package.json` file and replace the `dev` script from `remix dev` to `dotenv/config node_modules/.bin/remix dev`.

### Step 2 - Implement the core `createSessionStorage` to create the Upstash session implementation

Remix offers a great API to build your own Session integration using `createSessionStorage`. Let's implement this function to integrate Upstash.

```ts
// sessions/upstash.server.ts

import * as crypto from "crypto";

import { createSessionStorage } from "remix";

const upstashRedisRestUrl = process.env.UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL;

const headers = {
  Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN}`,
  Accept: "application/json",
  "Content-Type": "application/json",
};

const expiresToSeconds = (expires) => {
  const now = new Date();
  the expiresDate = new Date(expires);
  the secondsDelta = expiresDate.getSeconds() - now.getSeconds();
  return secondsDelta < 0 ? 0 : secondsDelta;
};

// For more info check https://remix.run/docs/en/v1/api/remix#createsessionstorage
export function createUpstashSessionStorage({ cookie }: any) {
  return createSessionStorage({
    cookie,
    async createData(data, expires) {
      // Create a random id - taken from the core `createFileSessionStorage` Remix function.
      const randomBytes = crypto.randomBytes(8);
      const id = Buffer.from(randomBytes).toString("hex");
      // Call Upstash Redis HTTP API. Set expiration according to the cookie `expired property.
      // Note the use of `expiresToSeconds` that converts the date to seconds.
      await fetch(
        `${upstashRedisRestUrl}/set/${id}?EX=${expiresToSeconds(expires)}`,
        {
          method: "post",
          body: JSON.stringify({ data }),
          headers,
        },
      );
      return id;
    },
    async readData(id) {
      const response = await fetch(`${upstashRedisRestUrl}/get/${id}`, {
        headers,
      });
      try {
        const { result } = await response.json();
        return JSON.parse(result).data;
      } catch (error) {
        return null;
      }
    },
    async updateData(id, data, expires) {
      await fetch(
        `${upstashRedisRestUrl}/set/${id}?EX=${expiresToSeconds(expires)}`,
        {
          method: "post",
          body: JSON.stringify({ data }),
          headers,
        },
      );
    },
    async deleteData(id) {
      await fetch(`${upstashRedisRestUrl}/del/${id}`, {
        method: "post",
        headers,
      });
    },
  });
}
```

Let's explain what we just wrote:
We created a file named `sessions/upstash.server.ts`. This file exports a function named `createUpstashSessionStorage`.
This function takes as a parameter a `cookie` (more on that later) and uses the core Remix `createSessionStorage` factory function to implement a new session provider.

Inside the function, we implemented the `createSessionStorage` protocol for creating a new session (`createData`), reading the session value (`readData`), updating the session value (`updateData`), and deleting the session (`deleteData`).

Each function uses the `REST` Upstash API to interact with the Redis Database.

#### Things to note:

- The passed cookie holds the `cookie expiration date` in `js Date` format. We use the `expiresToSeconds` function to convert the data to seconds as Redis expects.
- When setting a cookie don't forget to set its expiration date. Redis will automatically delete those sessions when they are expired.
- We use `crypto` to create a unique session id. You can use other alternatives for creating unique ids. I chose this option as it is the same used in the core `createFileSessionStorage` [function](https://github.com/remix-run/remix/blob/main/packages/remix-node/sessions/fileStorage.ts).

### Step 3 - Use the `createSessionStorage` in your app

Now that we've created our own session storage implementation, let's demonstrate how to use it.

> Note that from now on there is nothing specific to Upstash. All the logic is encapsulated in the `sessions/upstash.server.ts` file.

```ts
// sessions.server.ts

import { createUpstashSessionStorage } from "~/sessions/upstash.server";
import { createCookie } from "remix";

// This will set the length of the session.
// For the example, we use a very short duration to easily demonstrate its functionality.
const EXPIRATION_DURATION_IN_SECONDS = 10;

const expires = new Date();
expires.setSeconds(expires.getSeconds() + EXPIRATION_DURATION_IN_SECONDS);

const sessionCookie = createCookie("__session", {
  secrets: ["r3m1xr0ck1"],
  sameSite: true,
  expires,
});

const { getSession, commitSession, destroySession } =
  createUpstashSessionStorage({ cookie: sessionCookie });

export { getSession, commitSession, destroySession };
```

Create a file named `sessions.server.ts` and paste the code above.
This file exports 3 functions `getSession`, `commitSession`, and `destroySession`. These functions allow the app to interact with the session. We also created a cookie to store a reference to the session in the client.

Set up the expiration duration according to your business needs. For more info read https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies

#### Using session in Remix routes

In Remix, you can define session usage per route. In the following example, we use the `session` on the `routes/index.tsx`. This example only demonstrates how to use the session API. Connecting the session to specific business logic is outside the scope of this post.

> If you are looking for an example of how to use a session for authentication see https://github.com/remix-run/remix/tree/main/examples/remix-auth-form

```tsx
// routes/index.tsx

import { commitSession, getSession } from "~/sessions.server";
import type { LoaderFunction } from "remix";
import { json, useLoaderData } from "remix";

export const loader: LoaderFunction = async ({ request }) => {
  // Get the session from the cookie
  the session = await getSession(request.headers.get("Cookie"));
  the myStoredData = session.get("myStoredData");
  // If no session is found (was never created or was expired), create a new session.
  if (!myStoredData) {
    session.set("myStoredData", "Some data");
    return json(
      {
        message: "Created new session",
      },
      {
        headers:
```
