Vercel just announced [Vercel Workflow](https://useworkflow.dev/), their new take on durable workflows.
It looks clean, smooth, and fits right into the Vercel ecosystem.
But here’s the thing: **looking nice and working well in production are two different stories.**

At [Upstash](https://upstash.com/docs/introduction), we’ve been running **Upstash Workflow** in production for over a year. It’s built to handle real traffic, real failures, and real customers. It’s also built on top of QStash, which is designed for more technically inclined developers who prefer to avoid any “magic” and maintain full control. I won’t go into the details of QStash today and will mostly compare the Workflow products only.

So, while Vercel’s new product is fun to play with, it’s still missing the parts that matter when you leave the demo stage.

If you don’t want to read the whole post:
**Vercel Workflow is a nice toy for vibe coders. Upstash Workflow is for teams that actually need things to run reliably.**

Let me start with the common `compiler directive magic` debate and why it is not the crucial point to discuss. Then I’ll mention where **Vercel Workflow** will fall short with the features they currently have.

## The Compiler Directive Debate

One of the hot topics around Vercel Workflow is their use of **compiler directives** the `"use workflow"` magic comment that turns regular functions into workflows.
It’s clever and makes the code look cleaner:

```ts
// Vercel Workflow
export async function welcome(userId: string) {
  "use workflow";

  const user = await getUser(userId);
  const { subject, body } = await generateEmail({ name: user.name, plan: user.plan });

  await sleep("1 day");

  const { status } = await sendEmail({ to: user.email, subject, body });

  return { status, subject, body };
}
```

Meanwhile, here’s what it looks like in Upstash:

```ts
// Upstash Workflow
async function welcome(ctx: WorkflowContext<string>) {
  const userId = ctx.requestPayload;

  const user = await ctx.run("getUser", () => getUser(userId));
  const { subject, body } = await ctx.run("generateEmail", () =>
    generateEmail({ name: user.name, plan: user.plan })
  );

  ctx.sleep("wait", "1d");

  const { status } = await ctx.run("sendEmail", () =>
    sendEmail({ to: user.email, subject, body })
  );

  return { status, subject, body };
}
```

See the difference? It’s mostly about hiding the `ctx` part.

There’s been debate about whether hiding this logic is good or bad. Some say, “it’s too much magic.” Others love how simple it looks.
Honestly, both sides have a point. Vercel knows its audience, people who want things to just work, quickly.

It’s a bit like **Apple vs. Linux**: one hides the complexity, the other gives you full control.
But in the end, the compiler magic doesn’t really change how the system works.

The real difference comes down to **features**, and that’s where things matter in production.

## 1. Failure Handling That Actually Works

Every real system fails. APIs go down. Services time out. Retries aren’t enough.
So what happens when a workflow fails?

In Vercel Workflow, it seems... it just goes to the logs.
The problem? You need to poll the logs somewhere to check if there’s a failed one.
If needed, you have to write retry code yourself.
Once you start doing retries, you also need to do some bookkeeping to track what has been retried and what’s still waiting for attention.

In **Upstash Workflow**, failure handling is built into the core.
We track everything. You can:

* Write a `failureEndpoint` or `failureFunction` to handle failures without polling any endpoint.
* Find every failure in your **Dead Letter Queue (DLQ)**.
* **Retry**, **Resume**, or **Delete** (dismiss) failed runs. Available from both the UI or via API.

You’ll never lose an important operation again.

See:

* [Dead Letter Queue (DLQ)](https://upstash.com/docs/workflow/features/dlq)
* [Failure Callback](https://upstash.com/docs/workflow/features/failure-callback)

## 2. Scheduling Beyond “Hello World”

Vercel’s scheduling looks simple and clean. For small demos, it is.
To remind you, the following is what is [suggested](https://x.com/rauchg/status/1981426366982824387) at the moment:

```ts
async function daily() {
  "use workflow";

  while (true) {
    await sleep("1 day");
    await yourThing();
  }
}
```

In production, you’ll quickly run into missing pieces.

Need to delete a user’s scheduled task? Change a schedule’s interval? Search for schedule related runs?
You’ll have to build all that bookkeeping yourself.

With **Upstash Workflow**, scheduling is first class.
You can manage schedules from the UI or API, change intervals, and track all runs in one place. You can even search the logs for schedule related executions.

See: [Scheduling in Upstash Workflow](https://upstash.com/docs/workflow/howto/schedule)

## 3. Flow Control: Reactive vs Proactive

Every service you integrate with - OpenAI, Stripe, email APIs - has rate limits.
Vercel’s approach is reactive: call the API, hit a rate limit, catch it, then throw `RetryLater` to try again.
That sounds okay until your app scales. Then it becomes a retry storm, wasted executions, extra cost, and unnecessary load.

**Upstash Workflow** flips this model.
We let you define limits (requests per second, concurrency caps, etc.), and we handle the throttling automatically.
You never hit a rate limit. You never waste retries. Your costs stay predictable.

See: [Flow Control Documentation](https://upstash.com/docs/workflow/features/flow-control)

## 4. Observability You Can Rely On

Vercel’s UI is minimal. There’s no search, no filters, and no way to find a specific workflow by ID.

That’s fine for a weekend project, but if you have millions of workflow runs per day like our users, you need serious visibility.
When one of your customers asks what happened with their action last week, you should be able to find it instantly.

Upstash Workflow gives you full observability:

* Filter and search runs by date, ID, or label.
* Link workflows to your specific users or actions using [labels](https://upstash.com/docs/workflow/basics/client/trigger#param-label).
* Investigate and fix problems right from the dashboard.

That’s how you run workflows at scale.


## 5. Platforms and Languages That Actually Exist

Vercel Workflow provides a **"World" interface** to make the API usable on platforms other than Vercel.
In theory, that sounds nice. In practice, there are only a few toy implementations, and there’s little incentive for the community to maintain or productionize them. Most of the real-world use cases will stay locked inside the Vercel ecosystem.

**Upstash Workflow**, on the other hand, supports multiple platforms out of the box.
You can deploy and run your workflows in 9 different platforms including Vercel, Claudflare, Tanstack. 

See the full list at [Supported Platforms](https://upstash.com/docs/workflow/quickstarts/platforms) page.

Beyond platforms, **we also support multiple languages**.
TypeScript is just the start . *Python** is already available, and **Go** is on the way.

It’s unlikely that Vercel will ever provide first-class support for any other language, which limits their workflow ecosystem to a single stack.

## Wrapping Up

Vercel Workflow is a cool experiment. It’s smooth, fun, and easy to play with. If you’re prototyping or “vibe coding,” you’ll probably enjoy it.

But when you need something **durable, observable, and production ready**, the cracks start to show.
Retries, scheduling, rate limits, observability. These are the boring parts that become **critical** once you go live.

That’s why we built **Upstash Workflow**. It’s been battle tested for a year and handles everything from AI pipelines to billing systems without hidden costs or retry chaos.
