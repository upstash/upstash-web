[Deno Deploy](https://deno.com/deploy) is a distributed system that runs
javascript, typescript and webassembly at the edge, worldwide. You don't need to
deal with infrastructure at all, but instead just upload your code and you are
done. [QStash](https://upstash.com/qstash) is a message-queue/scheduler with the
same benefits, because it is 100% serverless and offers per-request pricing.

Together they can be used to build failure-tolerant asynchronous processing in
serverless functions with minimal setup.

Let's take a look on how to use QStash together with Deno. To highlight the
simplicity, we will do everything within the code editor at
[dash.deno.com](https://dash.deno.com)

## 1. Create a new project

Go to [dash.deno.com/new](https://dash.deno.com/new) and create a new playground
project by clicking on `Play` ![](/blog/qstash/deno/new_project.png)

## 2. Edit the handler function

QStash uses HTTP requests to push messages to your API, we offer a simple
utility to verify the authenticity of each incoming request. Just import the
`Receiver` class and create a new instance with your secret signing keys.
Replace the existing code with the following:

```ts
import { serve } from "https://deno.land/std@0.142.0/http/server.ts";
import { Receiver } from "https://deno.land/x/upstash_qstash@v0.1.4/mod.ts";

serve(async (req: Request) => {
  const r = new Receiver({
    currentSigningKey: Deno.env.get("QSTASH_CURRENT_SIGNING_KEY")!,
    nextSigningKey: Deno.env.get("QSTASH_NEXT_SIGNING_KEY")!,
  });

  const body = await req.text();
  const isValid = await r
    .verify({
      signature: req.headers.get("Upstash-Signature")!,
      body,
    })
    .catch((err: Error) => {
      console.error(err);
      return false;
    });

  if (!isValid) {
    return new Response("Invalid signature", { status: 401 });
  }
  // At this point the request is valid and you can start processing the message
  console.log(body);

  return new Response("OK", { status: 200 });
});
```

## 3. Add your signing keys

Click on the settings button at the top of the screen and then click + Add
Variable

Get your `QSTASH_CURRENT_SIGNING_KEY` and `QSTASH_NEXT_SIGNING_KEY` from
[Upstash](https://console.upstash.com/qstash) and then set them in deno deploy.

## 4. Deploy

Simply click on Save & Deploy at the top of the screen.

## 5. Publish a message

Make note of the url displayed in the top right. This is the public url of your
project.

```bash
curl --request POST "https://qstash.upstash.io/v1/publish/https://early-frog-33.deno.dev" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer <QSTASH_TOKEN>" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d "{ \"hello\": \"world\"}"
```

In the logs below the code editor you should see something like this:

```bash
Listening on http://localhost:8000/
{"hello": "world"}
```

## Next Steps

That's it, you have successfully created a secure deno API, that receives and
verifies incoming webhooks from qstash.
