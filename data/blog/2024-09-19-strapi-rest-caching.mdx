## Introduction

In this guide, we'll explore how to implement caching in your Strapi application using Upstash Redis. This will significantly improve your app's performance by reducing response times for frequently accessed data.

## Getting Started

### Creating the Strapi Application

First, we need to initialize a new Strapi application. Run the following command:

```bash
npx create-strapi-app@latest school --quickstart --typescript
```

This command will prompt you to authenticate yourself. After authentication, the dependencies will automatically be installed, and the project will run on your local machine.
You'll then be prompted to create an admin account for your app.

Great! The basic application is ready! Let's move on to creating content types and adding data to our database.

### Creating a Content Type

On the dashboard, navigate to the **Content-Type Builder** section on the sidebar. You'll see a default content type called **User** with pre-added fields.

![Adding new collection type](/blog/strapi-rest-caching/new-collection-type.jpeg)

Click on **Create new collection type** to create a new content type. For this example, we'll create a content type called **Course** with the following fields:

- **Title**: A text field to store the title of the course.
- **Description**: A text field to store the description of the course.

After clicking the **Save** button, you'll see the new content type on the sidebar.

Now, lets add some data. Go to **Content Manager -> Course** section on the sidebar and click on **Create new entry**, fill in the fields and click the **Save** and then **Publish**.

To make our application publicly accessible, go to **Settings -> Users & Permissions Plugin > Roles**. Edit the Public role and enable the `find` and `findone` permissions for the **Course** content type.

Let's test our Strapi application. Open a new terminal window and run:

```bash
curl http://localhost:1337/api/courses
```

You should see output similar to this:

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "attributes": {
        "title": "Data Structures and Algorithms",

      }
    }
  ],

    "pagination": {

      "pageSize": 25,
      "pageCount": 1,
      "total": 1
    }
  }
}
```

### Adding Caching to Strapi

To implement caching, we'll use the [`strapi-plugin-rest-cache` package](https://market.strapi.io/plugins/strapi-plugin-rest-cache), which is already available on Strapi marketplace.

Install it along with its dependencies:

```bash
npm install strapi-plugin-rest-cache strapi-plugin-redis strapi-provider-rest-cache-redis
```

Next, add this configuration to the `./config/plugins.ts` file in the Strapi project:

```typescript
export default () => ({
  redis: {
    enabled: true,
    config: {
      connections: {
        default: {
          connection: {
            host: "YOUR_REDIS_ENDPOINT",
            port: 6379,
            username: "default",
            password: "YOUR_REDIS_PASSWORD"
            tls: true,
          },
          settings: {
            debug: true,
          },
        },
      },
    },
  },

  "rest-cache": {
    config: {
      enabled: true,
      provider: {
        name: "redis",
        options: {
          max: 32767,
          connection: "default",
        },
      },
      strategy: {
        contentTypes: [
          {
            contentType: "api::course.course",
            routes: [
              {
                path: "/api/courses",
                method: "GET",
              },
            ],
          },
        ],
      },
    },
  },
});
```

### Create a Redis Database on Upstash

The final step is to create a new database on Upstash Redis.

1. Head over to the [Upstash Console](https://console.upstash.com/redis) and create a new database.
2. Once created, you'll see the connection details on the dashboard.

![Upstash Redis connection details](/blog/strapi-rest-caching/credentials.jpeg)

Replace `YOUR_REDIS_ENDPOINT` and `YOUR_REDIS_PASSWORD` in the `./config/plugins.ts` file with your actual connection details.

Now, restart the Strapi server:

```bash
npm run develop
```

We are all set to test the caching configuration:

```bash
curl http://localhost:1337/api/courses
```

The first request will return data as usual. Subsequent requests should be noticeably faster due to caching. This is because the response is now being cached in the Redis database and access to Redis database is usually faster, compared to SQL databases.

To verify caching, check the **Data Browser** section of your Upstash Redis database, and you'll see the `/api/courses?&` entry, which belongs to the request we made.

That's it! You've successfully added caching to your Strapi application using Upstash Redis. You can now scale your application without worrying about performance bottlenecks.

### Conclusion

And there we are! We've just charged our Strapi application with Upstash Redis. Let's take a moment to appreciate what we've accomplished here:

1. We've set up a Strapi project from scratch.
2. We've created custom content type and populated it with data.
3. Most importantly, we've took a significant step in optimization by caching. It will help us to reduce the response time and improve the performance of our application.

#### Note on Cache Management

Before you go off to enjoy your newly optimized Strapi app, remember that the `strapi-plugin-rest-cache` is pretty smart about managing itself:

- It automatically updates the cache when you make changes to your content using POST or DELETE methods. No manual intervention required!
- If you ever need to clear the cache manually (hey, it happens), just head over to the Strapi admin panel and hit that Content Manager > Purge REST Cache button. It's like a reset button for your cache.

So what's next? We'll, that's up to you! Maybe you'll add more complex content types or strategies. Whatever you do, you'll now be faster.

Happy coding!
