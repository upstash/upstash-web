It is a common need to restrict access to your website to some specific IP addresses.
In this post, I will show how to implement an IP Allow/Deny list using edge computing. Let me first introduce Cloudflare Workers.

### Cloudflare Workers

[Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/) have become quite a popular technology in recent years. It became [publicly available](https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-cloudflare-workers/) in 2017 and
Cloudflare KV storage became [publicly available](https://blog.cloudflare.com/workers-kv-is-ga/) in 2019.

Without going into very deep details of Cloudflare Workers or KV storage, I will explain them briefly.
With Cloudflare Workers, you can intercept any HTTP request at the edge level, execute your code snippets, and manipulate the request/response.
Also, you can use KV storage to perform put/get operations on a dictionary, which is natively available inside Cloudflare Workers.
You can quickly try the [playground environment](https://cloudflareworkers.com/); it is quite simple and offers a 1-click test environment.

Apart from the Cloudflare KV Storage, as a developer you might need more advanced data structures.
Also you might want to access KV storage from outside (like from a backend or an API or SDK clients).
So, recently we have enabled the REST API for Upstash.

Now, you can access your [Upstash](https://upstash.com/) Redis database using:

- [Upstash Rest API](/docs/features/restapi) in Cloudflare Workers
- [redis-cli](https://redis.io/topics/rediscli) in your command line terminal
- Any [redis client](https://redis.io/clients) in that particular programming language

Please click the `connect` button on your database details page for some sample code snippets and commands.

Let's make a small application using Cloudflare Workers and explore the Upstash Redis REST API together.

### Application

**_IP Allow/Deny in Cloudflare worker using Redis as a source of truth._**

### Prerequisites

- A Serverless Redis Database (You can create one from the [Upstash Console](https://console.upstash.com/))
- A Cloudflare account, or you can use the [CF Playground](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/learning/playground)
- Basic javascript knowledge
- Basic [Cloudflare Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/get-started/guide) knowledge

:::note
Select **Global Database** while creating Upstash database. Global database replicates data to multiple regions to lower the latency from the edge functions.
:::

Let's create a Cloudflare Worker and intercept the request. When you create a worker, it will automatically come with
sample code.

### Implementation

Let's Get the IP address of the visitor:

```javascript
async function handleRequest(request) {
  const ip = request.headers.get("cf-connecting-ip");
  return new Response(ip);
}
```

It is possible to get a visitor's IP address from the header. Now, we want to check whether this IP address is in the allowed
list or not. Let's make a single REST API call and improve our code.

```javascript
async function handleRequest(request) {
  const ip = request.headers.get("cf-connecting-ip");
  res = await fetch(
    "https://YOUR_DATABASE_ENDPOINT/sismember/allowed-set/" +
      ip +
      "?_token=YOUR_REST_API_TOKEN",
  );
  if ((await res.text()).includes("1")) {
    return new Response(ip + " is allowed.");
  }
  return new Response(ip + " is not allowed.");
}
```

Now, we make a REST API call to our Upstash Redis Server and check if the IP address is in the list. If the result
contains "1" then it means it is in the list, otherwise it doesn't.

You can update the Redis set using redis-cli with following command:

```
sadd allowed-set $IP_ADDRESS
```

### Conclusion and Future Work

Now, it is possible to access your Redis server instance using the REST API.
We are supporting almost all commands using the REST API. Please take a look at [our documentation](/docs/features/restapi) for more details.
With Cloudflare KV storage, you are bound to only KV dictionary API and it is not easy to access Cloudflare Workers KV from 3rd party applications.
But Redis offers a huge number of different client SDKs and redis-cli. Also in Upstash you can access your Redis database using REST API.

This simple application can be extended to serve as a kind of security guard in Cloudflare Workers. Users can change config values in Redis database and Cloudflare Worker can read configuration from the Redis.
