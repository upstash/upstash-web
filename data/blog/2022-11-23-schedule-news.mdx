Let's look closely at the
[Upstash-Callback](https://docs.upstash.com/qstash/features/callbacks) property
that can be used with the QStash services.

Quick recap': **What is a callback function?**

A callback function is a function that is accessible by another function and is
invoked after the first function if that first function completes. It is
“**called at the back**” of the passed function.

### **What will we build?**

In this post, we will build a simple application that will fetch the most
popular viewed articles from the New York Times once a day via a cron job and
post them to our internal discord _#notifications_ channel to stay up to date
with the outside world - creating discussions around non-technical hot topics.

### Application

If you don't already have an existing Next.js application, you can create one
with `npx create-next-app@latest`. We will use Next.js to write our API
endpoint.

To build our example, we will need the QStash-SDK. Install it with the
following:

```bash
npm install @upstash/qstash
```

Qstash by [Upstash](http://upstash.com) is a powerful messaging and scheduling
solution that we will use to create a cron job and include a callback URL that
will be called once the published request has finished, including the response
of the request.

#### Create the Callback API endpoint

The only part to code is the `/api/callback` URL to forward the message received
to the Discord webhook.

Let's break the file down into the parts and start with the imports.

We will need `verifySignature` to verify that the request is coming from QStash
and type the handler with the Next.js request and response types.

```tsx
// pages/api/callback.ts_(1/4)
import type { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from "next";
import { verifySignature } from "@upstash/qstash/nextjs";
```

The `sendMessage` function will forward the processed API response to our
Discord channel.

Please bare with me that we'll use `any` as there is not something like a
`@types/nytimes-api` to type the incoming request quickly. Read more about the
supported properties at
[developer.nytimes.com](https://developer.nytimes.com/docs/most-popular-product/1/routes/viewed/%7Bperiod%7D.json/get).
Moreover, I won't go too much into the Discord API possibilities. Feel free to
explore the
[gist](https://gist.github.com/Birdie0/78ee79402a4301b1faf412ab5f1cdcf9) and
extend the example with your use case.

```tsx
// pages/api/callback.ts_(2/4)
async function sendMessage(json: any) {
  return fetch(process.env.DISCORD_WEBHOOK!, {
    method: "POST",
    headers: {
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      username: "Best of NYTimes Bot",
      avatar_url: "https://picsum.photos/200", // random image generator
      // we will only post the five most popular articles of the day
      embeds: json.results.slice(0, 5).map((article: any) => {
        return {
          title: article.title,
          description: article.abstract,
          url: article.url,
        };
      }),
    }),
  });
}
```

Now that we have the helper function, let's continue with our **request
handler**.

The request we are getting from QStash is `base64` encoded. Once decoded, we can
process the result and send the message to our Discord server.

```tsx
// pages/api/callback.ts_(3/4)
async function handler(req: NextApiRequest, res: NextApiResponse) {
  try {
    // requests from Upstash-Callback are base64-encoded
    const decoded = Buffer.from(req.body.body, "base64");
    const json = JSON.parse(decoded.toString());
    const result = await sendMessage(json);
    if (!result.ok) {
      return res.status(500).end();
    }
    return res.status(201).end();
  } catch (e) {
    return res.status(500).end(e);
  }
}
```

Finally, we export our handler, wrapped by the `verifySignature` function, that
needs to access the `raw-body` of the request via the exported config (see
Nextjs
[docs](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/request-helpers#custom-config)).

```jsx
// pages/api/callback.ts_(4/4)
export const config = {
  api: {
    bodyParser: false,
  },
};

export default verifySignature(handler);
```

#### Get the secrets / API keys

Go to your [QStash dashboard](https://console.upstash.com/qstash) and copy and
paste the `QSTASH_CURRENT_SIGNING_KEY` and `QSTASH_NEXT_SIGNING_KEY` into your
`.env.local` environment variables.

For Discord, you can select the “Edit Channel” button and go to “Integrations >
Webhooks” directly inside the App to “Copy [the] Webhook URL”.

![CleanShot 2022-11-07 at 14.17.52@2x.png](/blog/qstash/news/CleanShot_2022-11-07_at_14.17.522x.png)

![CleanShot 2022-11-14 at 20.22.20.png](/blog/qstash/news/CleanShot_2022-11-14_at_20.22.20.png)

Your `.env.local` file should include the following:

```bash
## .env.local
QSTASH_CURRENT_SIGNING_KEY=<YOUR_CURRENT_KEY>
QSTASH_NEXT_SIGNING_KEY=<YOUR_NEXT_KEY>
DISCORD_WEBHOOK=https://discord.com/api/webhooks/XXX/YYY-ZZZZ
```

Start the development server for the changes to take effect.

```bash
$ npm run dev
```

To access the New York Times API, you'll need to create an account at
[developer.nytimes.com](http://developer.nytimes.com) and create an App to
access the API key. Be aware that your API is restricted by default. Enable the
“Most Popular API”.

![CleanShot 2022-11-14 at 20.11.00.png](/blog/qstash/news/CleanShot_2022-11-14_at_20.11.00.png)

You can check if it works by calling
`https://api.nytimes.com/svc/mostpopular/v2/viewed/1.json?api-key=<your-key>` in
the browser or any API platform like [postman](https://postman.com).

Before configuring QStash, we have to publicly access our `/api/callback`. For
that, we have two options:

1. Either run it locally with an
   [ngrok tunnel](https://docs.upstash.com/qstash/howto/local-tunnel) (because
   [localhost](http://localhost) is **not** publicly accessible)

```bash
$ ngrok http 3000 ## port number
```

1. Or deploying it to a hosting provider (e.g. [vercel.com](http://vercel.com) -
   don't forget to include the environment variables).

For the sake of this example, I've chosen the `ngrok` option.

#### Create the schedule

We can use the QStash Request Builder to start with and add the
`-H "Upstash-Callback: XXX-YYY-ZZZ.ngrok.io/api/callback" \` value separately as
it isn't included for now.

![CleanShot 2022-11-14 at 22.00.18.png](/blog/qstash/news/CleanShot_2022-11-14_at_22.00.18.png)

Running the following command will then start our cron job.

```jsx
curl -XPOST "https://qstash.upstash.io/v1/publish/https://api.nytimes.com/svc/mostpopular/v2/viewed/1.json?api-key=your-key" \
  -H "Upstash-Callback: XXX-YYY-ZZZ.ngrok.io/api/callback" \ 
	-H "Upstash-Cron: 0 8 * * *" \ 
  -H "Authorization: Bearer XXX"
```

Let's decompose the request:

1. QStash will call the NY Times API
   `https://qstash.upstash.io/v1/publish/https://api.nytimes.com/svc/mostpopular/v2/viewed/1.json?api-key=<your-key>`
   and
2. return the result to the defined callback at
   `"Upstash-Callback: XXX-YYY-ZZZ.ngrok.io/api/callback"`
3. every morning at 8 am via `"Upstash-Cron: 0 8 * * *"` (learn more at
   [crontab.guru](https://crontab.guru/#0_8_*_*_*))
4. providing authorization with `"Authorization: Bearer XXX"` to allow our call
   to be also verified via `verifySignature`.

### Conclusion

Let's wrap it up. Every morning at 8 am, Qstash will request the most popular NY
Times articles of the day and will forward the results to our callback URL
(`/api/callback`) where we will post them to our Discord channel.
