## Why I Stopped Using Next.js Navigation

Next.js has been my go-to framework for building full-stack apps for years. Built-in API routes, image optimization, and good integrations, there are a lot of reasons to use it. But there's one part I'm not a fan of...

and that's **page navigation**.

Navigations in the app router have always felt slow to me. So I've been experimenting with different ways to get instant page navigation speed. The result is **the fastest Next.js app I've probably ever built**.

<Note>
  I'm already using the pattern I'm showing you here in production. I got the
  idea for this implementation from [Theo](https://x.com/theo) - the same
  approach I'm showing you here powers his [t3 chat](https://t3.chat/) app.

Here's an overview of the architecture:

## 1. Install React Router

Opting out of Next.js's default navigation is surprisingly easy with react-router (formerly part of Remix):

```bash
npm i react-router
```

---

### 2. Create a Static App Shell

This page is a simple wrapper that dynamically loads the frontend app we will create.

```tsx title="app/static-app-shell/page.tsx"
"use client";

import dynamic from "next/dynamic";

// ðŸ‘‡ we'll create this in step 4
const App = dynamic(() => import("@/frontend/app"), { ssr: false });

export default function Home() {
  return <App />;
}
```

---

### 3. Update Next.js Config

In our `next.config.js`, we rewrite all non-API routes to our static app shell:

```typescript title="next.config.mjs"
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
  rewrites: async () => {
    return [
      {
        // ðŸ‘‡ matches all routes except /api
        source: "/((?!api/).*)",
        destination: "/static-app-shell",
      },
    ];
  },
};

export default nextConfig;
```

---

### 4. Define Routes With React Router

Let's define the app we import in our static shell. We'll create it in a folder different from our main app, for example, '/frontend`. Here, we use [react-router navigation](https://reactrouter.com/start/declarative/routing) to create pages and which components they render.

```tsx title="src/frontend/app.tsx"
import { BrowserRouter, NavLink, Route, Routes } from "react-router";

export default function App() {
  return (
    <BrowserRouter>
      <Routes>
        <Route path="/page-one" element={<p>page one</p>} />
        <Route path="/page-two" element={<p>page two</p>} />
      </Routes>
    </BrowserRouter>
  );
}
```

That's it - we now have full client-side routing in Next.js! ðŸŽ‰

All components we now create in our `/frontend` folder are automatically client components, so we need no more `use client`. Remember to use react-router's `<NavLink />` instead of NextJS `<Link />` for navigation.
