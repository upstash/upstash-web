Since our initial release last year, Upstash was compatible with RedisÂ® API up to version 5. Our Redis offering was lacking
commands such as `GETDEL`, `LMOVE`, `COPY` and features such as [ACL](https://redis.io/docs/manual/security/acl/)
which were introduced in Redis 6 (and 6.2).

Happy to announce that Upstash Redis databases are now compatible with Redis commands up to version 6.2.

### ACL Feature

With the new release, Upstash provides an always persistent [ACL](https://redis.io/docs/manual/security/acl/) implementation.
All `ACL` subcommands available in Redis 6.2 are supported by Upstash. Note that `ACL LOAD` and `ACL SAVE` commands are no-op
since every `ACL` update is persisted & replicated to all replicas immediately before `ACL` command returns the response.

Additionally Upstash provides a new `ACL` subcommand, named `ACL RESTTOKEN` to generate REST API tokens for the
users created via [`ACL SETUSER`](https://redis.io/commands/acl-setuser/):

```
ACL RESTTOKEN <username> <password>
    Generate a REST token for the specified username & password.
    Token will have the same permissions with the user.
```

You can execute `ACL RESTTOKEN` command via `redis-cli` or CLI on the Upstash console::

```shell
redis-cli> ACL RESTTOKEN default 35fedg8xyu907d84af29222ert
"AYNgAS2553feg6a2d9842h2a0gcdb5f8efe9934DQ="
```
