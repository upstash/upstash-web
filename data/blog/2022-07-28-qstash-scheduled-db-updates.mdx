For many applications, there is a need to insert or update data in your database
regularly. For example fetching metrics from somewhere or tracking the price of items.
You might want to update these every day, every hour, or every minute. Traditionally you
would have to setup a server, create a repeating job using `cron` or something
else and then maintain it. This server would continuously fetch updated prices
from an API and then insert them into your database.

What if you could just do this within your existing Next.js application without
any additional infrastructure?

[QStash](https://upstash.com/qstash) allows you to create schedules using [CRON](https://crontab.guru) and
will send an `HTTP` request to your API, whenever it triggers. This allows you
to run your business logic inside serverless functions on a schedule.

## What will we build?

In this post, we will build a simple
[application](https://qstash-examples-periodic-data-updates.vercel.app) to
continuously fetch the current USD price of Bitcoin from
[blockchain.info](https://blockchain.info/ticker) and store it in a Redis
database. I chose Redis here because it's very simple to set up, but you can use
any other database if you want.

## Application

If you don't have an existing Next.js application, you can create a new one with
`npx create-next-app@latest --ts`.

We need two dependencies to build our example:

- [@upstash/redis](https://github.com/upstash/upstash-redis) - Redis will serve
  as the database.
- [@upstash/qstash](https://github.com/upstash/sdk-qstash-ts) - The QStash sdk
  allows us to verify incoming webhooks from Upstash.

Install them with:

```bash
npm install @upstash/redis @upstash/qstash
```

### The API handler

Let's create a new api route in `/pages/api/cron.ts`, that will be called by
`QStash` when the schedule triggers.

Here are the dependencies:

```ts title="pages/api/cron.ts" {1/3}
import { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from "next";

import { verifySignature } from "@upstash/qstash/nextjs";
import { Redis } from "@upstash/redis";
```

Next, we create the actual handler function. Please note that it is not exported
yet!

The first step is to get fresh data from the API (blockchain.info in this
case), and then store it in our database of choice. Here we store the current
exchange rate together with the current timestamp.

````ts title="pages/api/cron.ts" {2/3}
async function handler(_req: NextApiRequest, res: NextApiResponse) {
  try {
    /**
     * The API returns something like this:
     * ```json
     * {
     *   "USD": {
     *     "last": 123
     *   },
     *   ...
     * }
     * ```
     */
    const raw = await fetch("https://blockchain.info/ticker");
    const prices = await raw.json();
    const bitcoinPrice = prices["USD"]["last"] as number;

    /**
     * After we have loaded the current bitcoin price, we can store it in the
     * database together with the current time
     */
    const redis = Redis.fromEnv();
    await redis.zadd("bitcoin-prices", {
      score: Date.now(),
      member: bitcoinPrice,
    });

    res.send("OK");
  } catch (err) {
    res.status(500).send(err);
  } finally {
    res.end();
  }
}
````

Lastly, we wrap the handler with `verifySignature`, so that we can verify that
the request is coming from Upstash. You can read more about this in the
[QStash documentation](/docs/qstash/features/security). And we
also need to disable automatic parsing of the request body, in order to allow
`verifySignature` to work properly.

```ts title="pages/api/cron.ts" {3/3}
/**
 * Wrap your handler with `verifySignature` to automatically reject all
 * requests that are not coming from Upstash.
 */
export default verifySignature(handler);

/**
 * To verify the authenticity of the incoming request in the `verifySignature`
 * function, we need access to the raw request body.
 */
export const config = {
  api: {
    bodyParser: false,
  },
};
```

The file can be found [here](https://github.com/upstash/qstash-examples/blob/main/periodic-data-updates/pages/api/cron.ts).

The next step is to deploy it on Vercel.

## Deployment

You can either push your code to a git repository and deploy it to Vercel, or
you can deploy it directly from your local machine using the
[vercel cli](https://vercel.com/docs/cli).

For a more in-depth tutorial on how to deploy to Vercel, check out this
[quickstart](/docs/qstash/quickstarts/vercel-nextjs#4-deploy-to-vercel).

After you have deployed your app, it is time to add your secrets to your
environment variables.

## Secrets

Head over to [QStash](https://console.upstash.com/qstash) and copy the
`QSTASH_CURRENT_SIGNING_KEY` and `QSTASH_NEXT_SIGNING_KEY` to vercel's
environment variables.

If you are not using a custom database, you can quickly create a new
[Redis database](https://console.upstash.com/redis). Afterwards copy the
`UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL` and `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN` to vercel.

You should now have 4 environment variables in your vercel project:

Redeploy the app for the changes to take effect.

## Create a schedule

The final step is to create a schedule that will trigger our handler function.

1. Go to [console.upstash.com/qstash](https://console.upstash.com/qstash) and
   scroll down to the Request Builder.
2. Configure the endpoint URL as `https://[YOUR_VERCEL_PROJECT_DOMAIN]/api/cron`
3. Select the type as `Scheduled`.
4. Configure the cron schedule to run whenever you want. (every hour in this
   case)
5. Click on Schedule.

## Wrapping up

That's it; your serverless function will now be called periodically and will insert
new data into the database.

After a while, you can check the data in the database. We have also created a
small frontend for this application but that is neither necessary, nor important
for this example. It involves a few more dependencies for styling and the chart,
but you can check it out
[here](https://github.com/upstash/qstash-examples/blob/main/periodic-data-updates/pages/index.tsx).
