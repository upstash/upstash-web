Meet Context7 — a tool I built after a year of working with coding assistants. LLMs mess up or mix library versions when APIs change fast. Context7 fixes that with quick, up-to-date context for your projects.

## TLDR
- Context7 gives fresh and high quality context for software packages in milliseconds.
- Pulls code snippets and short explanations from open-source docs.
- Smarter than raw docs: short, clean, and version-aware.
- Add new packages to the index in seconds (or minutes for big ones).

## Why?
We’re dealing with two developer headaches: AI out-of-date issues and version mix-ups.

### AI Knowledge Cutoff
You’re coding with upstash-workflow (out Dec 2024), but your LLM’s stuck at Nov 2024. It makes up fake APIs. Copying docs helps, but they’re bloated, hit token limits, and it’s best experience to copy page by page. Context7 delivers clean code snippets and explanations, with options to focus on what you need by reranking.

### Version Mix-Ups
Building a Next.js 15 site? Your LLM might include in v14 configs. Context7 uses the latest version snippets, updated often, so your assistant stays on the latest version.

## Why is Context7 free?
We are engineers of Upstash which has a large infrastructure. We want to run Context7 on our infrastructure using redundant resources. We want to help developers to adapt AI to their projects and keep Context7 free for personal and educational use. 


## How’s Context7 Different?
It’s not just a crawler. It’s a smart context system:  
1. Parse: Pulls code snippets from docs.  
2. Enrich: LLMs add short explanations and page context.  
3. Vectorize: Create embeddings for efficient search.  
4. Rerank: Puts the best stuff first for dev guides.  
5. Cache: Cached with Redis for the best performance
  
We use it ourselves, and continuously develop it. Tell us how to improve it!

## Use Cases
- Manual: Paste Context7 snippets into Cursor or Copilot, like "Build a Next.js API with Tailwind. Use this Next.js context: [Context7 snippet]".
- Auto: Use the MCP server to feed context to assistants.
- Agents: Use Context7 API in your coding agent for up-to-date package information.

## What’s llms.txt?
llms.txt is designed for LLMs, similar to how robots.txt is for crawlers. Unlike robots.txt, which provides full website content, llms.txt offers optimized, summarized content for LLMs.


### Does Context7 Make llms.txt?
Yes, but in a more special format. Context7 specializes in open source software packages, providing code snippets for coding assistants like Cursor and Windsurf.

### Open Source Authors
Add your project at [context7.com/add-package](https://context7.com/add-package) or send it via PR at [our GitHub](https://github.com/upstash/context7/tree/master/packages). Share your context link—like [context7.com/nextjs/llm.txt](https://context7.com/nextjs/llm.txt)—to help users.

## Assistants vs. Agents
- Assistants: Help devs code (e.g., Cursor, Copilot). You’re in charge.  
- Agents: Write code for you (e.g., V0, Replit). They are the main actors.  
- Hybrid: Cursor and Windsurf do both.  
- My opinion: If you are a beginner developeror non-technical then try coding agents. If you are medium to advanced developer then use coding assistants.

## What is Cursor? Why is it special?
Cursor and Windsurf are IDEs built on top of VSCode. They are special because they are built to work integrated with AI. Using Cursor and Windsurf, you can get help from LLMs any time while coding. They are pro actively suggest code completions which positively surprise many developers. Both have a limited free tier which is enough to try the tool. For continued use, you can subscribe to paid plans.


## Using Context7 with Cursor and Windsurf
- You can use Context7 with any coding assistant or agent. Context7 provides code examples to these tools to make them more accurate.

- You can use Context7 in 2 ways:
1- Manually copy paste the context to the prompt.
2- Use MCP server of Context7 to provide context in automated way to coding assistants.

## Roadmap
- Public MCP server (in private preview—join the waitlist!).  
- APIs/SDKs for easy access.  
- Older versions and private packages.  
- Snippet search and multi-package support.  
- Filter by language (Python, JS, etc.).

## Let’s Make It Better
Context7’s new, and we need your input. Share your ideas at context7@upstash.com or chat on [GitHub](https://github.com/upstash/context7). Let’s make AI coding less of a mess, together.
