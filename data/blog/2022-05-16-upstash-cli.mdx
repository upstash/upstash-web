One of the primary goals of Upstash is to enable every developer to easily create Upstash resources using various tools.
In the past, we have announced the [Developer API](https://developer.upstash.com/), [Terraform Provider](https://upstash.com/blog/redis-terraform), and now it is time for the Upstash CLI.

## Announcing @upstash/cli

We are thrilled to announce the Upstash command-line tool so that every developer can create their Upstash resources with a single command.

It is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/upstash/cli), [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@upstash/cli) or [built binaries](https://github.com/upstash/cli/releases/latest)

## Get started

The Upstash CLI requires a developer API key. A new API key can be created in the [Console](/docs/redis/account/developerapi).

```shell
npm install -g @upstash/cli
```

Or visit the GitHub [release page](https://github.com/upstash/cli/releases) for prebuilt binaries.

After installing, execute the following command to log in. It will ask for your email and API key:

```ts
upstash auth login
```

That's all. You are now logged in and can manage your Upstash resources from the command line.

If you are unsure what a command does, use the `--help` flag, and it will explain all the available commands and flags.

```shell
upstash redis --help
```

All parameters can be provided via the CLI, but the CLI will ask you if a required parameter is missing.

### Creating Resources

#### Creating Redis Database

```ts
upstash redis create --name=cli-powered-db --region=eu-central-1
```

You only need to provide the name of your database and its region. Other optional flags can be provided, like TLS, multizone, etc.

#### Creating Kafka Cluster

```ts
upstash kafka create --name=$name --region=$region
```

Similar to Redis, Kafka resources require two parameters: name and region. After creating a region, a topic can be created.

```ts
upstash kafka topic create --name=mytopic --cluster-id=$id
```

#### Other Commands

The Upstash CLI includes many different commands to perform CRUD operations on your Upstash resources.

- **Team**: This allows you to manage teams and their members

```shell
upstash team
```

- **Redis**: Create/edit/delete redis databases

```shell
upstash redis
```

- **Kafka**: Create/edit/delete kafka clusters and topics

```shell
upstash kafka cluster
upstash kafka topic
```
