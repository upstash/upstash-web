One of primary goals of Upstash is that every developer should create Upstash resources easily using various tools.
In the past we have announced [Developer Api](https://developer.upstash.com/), [Terraform Provider](https://upstash.com/blog/redis-terraform) and now it is time for Upstash CLI.


## Announcing @upstash/cli
We are thrilled to announce Upstash command line tool so that every developer can create their Upstash resources with single command.

It is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/upstash/upstash-cli), [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@upstash/cli) or [Deno](https://deno.land/x/upstash_cli)


## Get started

Upstash CLI requires developer api key. Api key can be created via [Console.](https://docs.upstash.com/redis/account/developerapi)

```ts
npm install -g @upstash/upstash-cli
```

After installing CLI execute following command, it will ask your email and apikey:

```ts
upstash login
```
That's all. You are now logged in and can manage your Upstash resources from the command line.


### Creating Resources

Upstash CLI has help command that explains all available commands and flags.
All parameters can be given via CLI but if a  required parameter is missing then CLI will ask you again for that parameter.


#### Creating Redis Database

```ts
upstash redis create --name $name --region $region
```
You only need to provide name of your database and region. There are other optional flags can be provided like tls, multizone etc.


#### Creating Kafka Cluster

```ts
upstash kafka create --name $name --region $region
```

Similar to redis, kafka resources requires 2 parameters name and region. After creating a region, a topic can be created.

```ts
upstash kafka add topic --name mytopic --cluster $cluster_name
```

#### Other Commands

Upstash CLI includes many different commands that gives you chance of CRUD operations on your Upstash Resources.
I would like to reference our documentation for full explanation of commands and Github README.
