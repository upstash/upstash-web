Recently, Next.js team has announced [Next 12.2](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-12-2#edge-api-routes-experimental). The most exciting news for me is the [Edge API Routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/edge-api-routes). Edge API Routes enable developers to run their APIs at edge locations. This is a great news if you need low latency all over the world.

In this article, I will create a basic API which will count the page views per each edge location. I will use [Upstash Global Redis](https://docs.upstash.com/redis/features/globaldatabase) to keep the page counts. Because Upstash replicates the data to multiple regions, it helps to keep the latency low. I will deploy the Next.js application to Vercel which supports the Edge runtime.

### Project Setup
- Create the project: `npx create-next-app@latest --typescript`

- Install Upstash Redis client: `npm install @upstash/redis`

<Note>
  You can use any Redis client, but we recommend @upstash/redis
</Note>

- Create a Global Redis database on [Upstash](https://console.upstash.com) and copy the REST URL and token.

### The Code

Update the

```javascript:pages/api/hello.ts

import type { NextRequest } from 'next/server';
import { Redis } from '@upstash/redis'

const redis = new Redis({
  url: 'REPLACE_YOUR_REST_URL',
  token: 'REPLACE_YOUR_TOKEN',
})

export default async(req: NextRequest) => {
  let loc = req.geo?.country || "World"
  const count = await redis.incr(loc);
  return new Response(`Location: ${loc}  View count: ${count}` );
};

export const config = {
  runtime: 'experimental-edge',
};
```

### Deploy
Run `vercel --prod` to deploy your application. Test the URL from different locations (you may use a VPN). You should see different view counts for each location.
