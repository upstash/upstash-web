[Serverless Cloud](http://cloud.serverless.com/) is a backend platform from the team who created the `Serverless Framework`. It provides a Cloud runtime, CLI, and SDK on a single platform to boost developer productivity. In this post, we will build a Next.js application that reads data from Serverless Redis (Upstash) and deploy it to Serverless Cloud.

### Setup

First, initiate the Serverless Cloud with: `npm init cloud`

```text
? Do you want to create a new app or work on an existing one?
â¹ You've selected Create new app.
â¹ Please choose an app template to generate in this directory.
â¹ You've selected Next.js.
â¹ Please enter a name for your app.
â¹ You've entered serverless-cloud.
```

Select `Next.js` as the template so a new Next.js project will be generated.

In the project folder, install the Upstash Redis client:
`npm install @upstash/redis`

Create a Redis database using the [Upstash Console](https://console.upstash.com/). Using the CLI, insert `users` data as below:

```text
set users '[{ "id": "12", "name": "John Doe"}, { "id": "13", "name": "Jane Smith"}]'
```

Update the `user.js` as below by replacing the Upstash REST URL and Token:

```js title="user.js"
// Next.js API route support: https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction
import { Redis } from "@upstash/redis";

const redis = new Redis({
  url: "REPLACE_HERE",
  token: "REPLACE_HERE",
});

export default async function handler(req, res) {
  const data = await redis.get("users");
  res.status(200).json({ users: data });
}
```

### Test and Deploy

In the Serverless Cloud interactive CLI, run `dev`. You will need to see something like the following on your http://localhost:3000/ :

As you see, the users that you stored in Redis are listed.

Deploy your application to the cloud with the command: `deploy dev` in the interactive CLI. You can check the metrics and application logs using the [Serverless Cloud dashboard](https://cloud.serverless.com/)

## Closing Words

In this post, we have created a Next.js application on Serverless Cloud and used Upstash Redis as the data store.
