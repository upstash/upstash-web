We are thrilled to announce the latest addition to our
[@upstash/ratelimit](https://github.com/upstash/ratelimit) library, the
**Rate Limit Analytics**! As the library gains more popularity, we have been
receiving valuable feedback on how we can improve it. One of the most requested
features was a way to have a better view of the overall performance and how
limits apply to different users in an application. The Rate Limit Dashboard
allows you to do just that. You can now easily visualize and analyze your rate
limits, giving you better insights into your application's performance. You can
access the Rate Limit Dashboard by visiting
[console.upstash.com/ratelimit](https://console.upstash.com/ratelimit) after
enabling analytics (see below).

If you're not familiar with `@upstash/ratelimit`, it is a TypeScript library
built on top of [Upstash for RedisÂ®](https://upstash.com/). It allows you to easily
add rate limiting to your application and works over HTTP, making it perfect for
stateless runtimes like serverless and edge. You can learn more about how it
works by reading our [announcement](/blog/upstash-ratelimit) or by checking out
the [repository](https://github.com/upsatsh/ratelimit).

## Enabling Analytics

Enabling analytics for `@upstash/ratelimit` is completely optional and does not
add any latency to your application's critical path. You can enable analytics by
configuring it in the Rate Limit constructor:

```ts
import { Ratelimit } from "@upstash/ratelimit";
import { Redis } from "@upstash/redis";

const ratelimit = new Ratelimit({
  redis: Redis.fromEnv(),
  limiter: Ratelimit.fixedWindow(10, "10s"),
  analytics: true, // <- add this line
});
```

## Console

Once you've enabled analytics, you can access the Rate Limit Dashboard by
visiting [console.upstash.com/ratelimit](https://console.upstash.com/ratelimit).
From there, you can select the database you're using for rate limiting and start
monitoring.

The best part is that using the `@upstash/ratelimit` SDK and dashboard is
completely free! You only pay for the underlying database used to store the
limits and analytics data. Our Redis **free tier** allows up to **10,000**
requests **per day** for free, and if you need more, you can upgrade for just
**$0.20** per **100,000** requests.
