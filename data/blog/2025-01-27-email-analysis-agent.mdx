In this tutorial, we'll build a sophisticated email analysis system that automatically processes emails and their attachments on _forward_ action using LLMs. We'll be combining DeepSeek R1's strong analysis capabilities with [Upstash Workflow](https://github.com/upstash/workflow-js)'s reliable agent framework.

You can access the final version of the project [here](https://github.com/upstash/email-analysis-agent).

## What are we building exactly?

Our system will:

- Orchestrate the whole process using [Upstash Workflow Agents](https://upstash.com/docs/workflow/agents/overview) with reliable/durable execution in serverless environment
- Automatically process forwarded emails using [Zapier](https://zapier.com/) as a webhook trigger
- Analyze email content and PDF attachments using DeepSeek R1
- Send professional email response suggestions through [Resend](https://resend.com)

## Technical Architecture

Let's dive into how our system works under the hood. We're implementing a multi-agent architecture where each agent specializes in specific tasks. Each agent is attached with a necessary tool.

You can access the final version of the project [here](https://github.com/upstash/email-analysis-agent/blob/master/app/analyze/route.ts).

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Project Setup

First, let's set up our development environment and necessary packages

```bash
# Create a new Next.js project
npx create-next-app@latest email-analysis --typescript --tailwind --app

# Navigate to project directory
cd email-analysis

# Install required dependencies
npm install @upstash/workflow ai zod pdf-parse resend
```

#### Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file in your project root.

```bash title=".env"
OPENAI_API_KEY=
QSTASH_TOKEN=
RESEND_API_KEY=
```

- For `QSTASH_TOKEN`, please navigate to `https://console.upstash.com/qstash`.
- For `RESEND_API_KEY`, sign up on `https://resend.com` and create yourself an API key.
- For `OPENAI_KEY`, please sign up on deepseek

### Step 2: Creating the Analysis Endpoint

We'll start by creating the overall layout of the project, which includes the necessary imports and creating the workflow endpoint.

Using the `serve` method is the fundamental logic of the Upstash Workflow library. We'll continue the implementation with creating the agents and their respective tasks, and wrapping them with the `serve` method will enable us to execute the agent tasks in a reliable manner.

#### 2.1 Layout and Imports

The below snippet sets up our basic imports and types. The `EmailPayload` type defines the structure of data we expect from Zapier Webhook.

```typescript title="app/api/analyze/route.ts"
import { serve } from "@upstash/workflow/nextjs";
import { tool } from "ai";
import { z } from "zod";
import pdf from "pdf-parse";
import { Resend } from "resend";

// Define our payload type
type EmailPayload = {
  message: string;
  subject: string;
  to: string;
  attachment?: string;
};

// Initialize Resend client
const resend = new Resend(process.env.RESEND_API_KEY);

// Workflow endpoint
export const { POST } = serve<EmailPayload>(async (context) => {
  const { message, subject, to, attachment } = context.requestPayload;
  const model = context.agents.openai("gpt-4");

  // Agents definitions and tasks will come here
});
```

To use the `pdf-parse` library, we need to do a small update in the `next.config.js` file.

```typescript title="next.config.js"
import type { NextConfig } from "next";

const nextConfig: NextConfig = {
  serverExternalPackages: ["pdf-parse"]
};

export default nextConfig;
```

#### 2.2 PDF Processing Agent

The PDF Processing Agent is the workhorse behind our document analysis capabilities. Think of it as a specialized worker whose sole job is to parse, read and understand PDF documents. When we create this agent, we give it a clear mission through its `background` prompt - it knows it's a specialist in extracting and summarizing information from PDFs.

The heart of this agent is its `processPDF` tool. When given a PDF URL(File URL of the mail attachment), it springs into action: downloading the document, converting into a format it can read and extracting the text content.

The tool(function) calling is a native feature of OpenAI compatible LLMs, and it shapes the core of the Upstash Workflow Agent library. To learn more you can see the [OpenAI Function Calling Docs](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling) or [tools section](https://upstash.com/docs/workflow/agents/features#tools) in Upstash Workflow Agents docs.

Now, let's create our first agent in the `serve` method.

```typescript title="app/api/analyze/route.ts"
export const { POST } = serve<EmailPayload>(async (context) => {
  const { message, subject, to, attachment } = context.requestPayload;
  const model = context.agents.openai("gpt-4");

	 const pdfAgent = context.agents.agent({
	    model,
	    name: 'pdfAgent',
	    maxSteps: 3,
	    background: 'You are a specialist in extracting and summarizing key information from PDF documents.',
	    tools: {
	        processPDF: tool({
	            description: 'Process and extract text from PDF attachments',
	            parameters: z.object({
	                attachmentUrl: z.string().describe('URL of the PDF attachment')
	            }),
	            execute: async ({ attachmentUrl }) => {
	                if (!attachmentUrl) {
	                    return { content: '' };
	                }

	                const response = await fetch(attachmentUrl);
	                const fileContent = await response.arrayBuffer();
	                const buffer = Buffer.from(fileContent);

	                try {
	                    const data = await pdf(buffer);
	                    return { content: data.text };
	                } catch (error) {
	                    console.error('Error parsing PDF:', error);
	                    return { content: 'Unable to extract PDF content' };
	                }
	            }
	        })
	    }
	});
});
```

#### 2.3 Email Composition Agent

Now that we have our PDF processing available, let's create an agent that specializes in composing thoughtful email responses. This agent will be responsible for understanding context from both the original thread and any PDF content, then crafting both a summary of the email thread and an appropriate response suggestion.

This agent will also use Resend API to actually deliver the email response back to you. We've equipped it with a `sendEmail` tool that handles the email delivery process. The tool uses Zod for parameter validation, making sure that we always have the required information in runtime before attempting to send an email.

#### 2.4 Orchestrating the Workflow

With both agents defined, we can now orchestrate the complete workflow, how these agents will share the tasks between them. This involves processing the PDF, and providing the context to `emailAgent` to generate the email response. To achieve this, we'll use the `task` API of Upstash Workflow Agents. We'll define a task for each of the agents and execute them.  

This workflow orchestration si where Upstash Workflow really shines. The tasks are executed in a reliable, durable manner, meaning that even if there are temporary failures or timeouts-related to serverless function- the workflow will continue from where it left off. This is particularly important when dealing with tasks that could take time like LLM completion, or 3rd party API calls .You can also investigate the logs related to your workflow on [Upstash Console](https://console.upstash.com).

Here's how we bring everything together:

```typescript title="app/api/analyze/route.ts"
export const { POST } = serve<EmailPayload>(async (context) => {
  const { message, subject, to, attachment } = context.requestPayload;
  const model = context.agents.openai('gpt-4');

  // ... agent definitions ...

  // Step 1: Process PDF if it exists
  let pdfContent = '';
  if (attachment) {
    const { text } = await context.agents.task({
      agent: pdfAgent,
      prompt: `Process this PDF attachment using the processPDF tool.
              Attachment URL: ${attachment}
              
              Extract and summarize the key information from this PDF.
              Return the extracted content in a clear, organized format.`
    }).run();
    pdfContent = text;
  }

  // Step 2: Generate and send email response
  await context.agents.task({
    agent: emailAgent,
    prompt: `You are going to compose an email and send it using the sendEmail tool.
            
            Email Parameters:
            TO: ${to}
            SUBJECT: ${subject}
            MESSAGE CONTEXT: ${message}
            PDF CONTENT: ${pdfContent}

            First, compose your email response. Then, use the sendEmail tool with these exact parameters:
            {
                "to": "${to}",
                "subject": "Analysis: ${subject}",
                "content": "YOUR_EMAIL_CONTENT"
            }

            The response should be concise but address all key points from both the message and PDF content.`
  }).run();
});
```

#### 2.5 Deployment

In order to work with Upstash Workflow, we need a publicly accesible endpoint. We can either use local development flow with `ngrok`, or deploy our project to Vercel.

We'll first start our local tunnel on port 3000 using ngrok. To learn more about local development, see [related docs](https://upstash.com/docs/workflow/howto/local-development).

```shell title="terminal"
ngrok http 3000
```

This will show you a publicly accesible endpoint. You can pass that to serve method as an option, as shown in the snippet

```typescript title="app/api/analyze/route.ts"
// Workflow endpoint
export const { POST } = serve<EmailPayload>(async (context) => {

  // Rest of the code from above
  // ...

}, {
  baseUrl: "https://1b3e-85-101-27-2.ngrok-free.app"
});
```

Make sure to save this endpoint somewhere, since we'll need it in the next step.

### Step 3: Setting Up the Zapier Integration

We now have the backend logic in place, but we still need to set up the trigger that will activate our workflow when you forward the thread to the email address dedicated to analysis agent.

There are several products to achieve this, like AWS SES, Mailgun or Zapier etc. For this guide we'll be using Zapier, since it has the easiest setup between these. But you can always use an integration of your liking. 

We'll use Zapier to monitor an email inbox and forward relevant emails to our analysis endpoint.

#### 3.1 Creating the Zap

First, log into your Zapier account and create a new Zap. We'd recommend using this [starting template](https://zapier.com/shared/3c0960d9339f19ec8549ebc6b3e01bc751c0e714) that we've created for you.

#### 3.2 Email Integration
We need an email address dedicated to the email analysis agent. This is kind of important, since we don't want to be spammed by our agent. In the first step of the **Zap**, connect the Gmail account of the agent. You can also use other integrations provided by Zapier for this step.

![email step](/blog/email-analysis-agent/zapier-email-step.png)

In the configuration section, select an example thread you'd normally would like to get analysis of. This will show you how emails are parsed in a Zap.

#### 3.3 Configuring Webhook Action

In the Zap's action step, we'll have a `Webhooks by Zapier` step, which sends an POST request to our backend when it detects a new email in the inbox.

For the `URL` field in the **Configure** section, make sure to use the local tunnel URL from the deployment section in the previous step.

The `data` field will be sent to the backend in the webhook event. Make sure to create the fields shown in the image.

![webhook configuration step](/blog/email-analysis-agent/zapier-webhook-step.png)

In the **Test** step, you can test the backend using the specific email you've selected in the previous step, as if that email was just sent to the inbox. 

#### 3.4 Publish the Zap

Using the **Publish** button on top right, release a version for your Zap. Then, we are ready to go!

## Next Steps and Possible Improvements

After implementing the basic system, there are some ways you could improve the system.

- Using AWS SES to receive and process incoming emails, which will allow/require you to use your own domain and store the attachments/email contents in an object storage like S3.
- This project now supports single image or pdf attachments, but you can customize it to support more.
