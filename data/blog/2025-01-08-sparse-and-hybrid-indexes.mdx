We are excited to announce a significant upgrade to our vector index.
Upstash Vector now supports sparse and hybrid indexes!

Up until now, Upstash Vector supported dense indexes for semantic similarity
searches. While dense indexes are a powerful and well-established approach,
they're not always the most effective solution for every type of data and query.

Before exploring the new types of indexes, let's recap what dense indexes
are and where they are useful. Imagine each piece of data you store — whether
it's text, images, audio, or something else — as a point in a high-dimensional
vector space. A dense index essentially creates a detailed "map" of this space,
where every single dimension is explicitly represented. This means each data
item needs a vector with a value for every dimension in the space.

Let's take a look at our [Wikipedia index](https://upstash.com/blog/indexing-wikipedia).
A dense vector for each paragraph of a Wikipedia article might have a
dimension for historical time period, geographical relevance,
cultural significance, scientific domain, and so on. Even if it is a paragraph
related to [semiconductors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiconductor),
the dense vector value would still reserves space for the
"geographical relevance" dimension and assign it a value, possibly close
to zero. This type of indexes are excellent at capturing overall similarity
and semantic relationships.

However, semantic search over dense indexes can struggle for out-of-domain queries
that the embedding model is trained on, or fail to provide best results for queries
containing rare words or features, such as industry-specific jargon.

Sparse indexes take a different approach, focusing on efficiency and specificity.
Instead of storing a value for every dimension, they only store the non-zero or,
more generally, the significant values out of the much higher dimensional space.
This is particularly useful when dealing with data that has a large number of
potential features, but only a small subset of those features are active or relevant
for any given data item. It's conceptually similar to a keyword search, but
operating in the realm of vectors.

Returning to our semiconductor paragraph example, a sparse index might only record
the important keywords that are actually in the paragraph, like the keywords
"semiconductor", "conductor", "insulator", "electrical", "current", without wasting
space on all the other possible keywords. This makes sparse indexes ideal for
situations where data has variable-length features or attributes, such as text documents,
product catalogs with many optional attributes, or user profiles with diverse interests.

Sparse indexes offer several advantages. They use less storage space because they
only keep track of the relevant dimensions of the data. This leads to faster retrieval
times, particularly for queries that focus on specific features or attributes.
The search algorithm doesn't have to sift through irrelevant dimensions. Another benefit
is that it is easier to understand why two items are considered similar because the
index only considers the shared non-zero dimensions. This makes debugging and explaining
search results easier. Finally, sparse indexes are great for data where different items
have different numbers of features or attributes, so you can avoid padding vectors with
zeros to a fixed length.

However, exact keyword or feature search over sparse indexes can fail to capture
contextual information or even struggle with queries containing synonym keywords.

Now, let's consider the common scenario where your data exhibits both dense and sparse
characteristics. For example, you might have text documents where you want to capture
both the overall semantic meaning and specific keywords or topics. This is where the
power of hybrid indexes comes into play.

Hybrid indexes cleverly combine dense and sparse indexing techniques, allowing you to
leverage the strengths of both approaches within a single system.

Before moving on to the next section, where we explore how to use these new index types,
let us also mention that both sparse and hybrid indexes support all the features available
to dense indexes, like [namespaces](https://upstash.com/docs/vector/features/namespaces),
[metadata filtering](https://upstash.com/docs/vector/features/filtering), and
[resumable queries](https://upstash.com/docs/vector/features/resumablequery).

## Using Sparse Indexes

Go to [Upstash Console](https://console.upstash.com) to create a sparse index.

While creating the index, you can choose between doing the sparse vector
embedding yourself, or use one of the Upstash-hosted
[sparse embedding models](https://upstash.com/docs/vector/features/embeddingmodels#models)
to do it for you.

Using an Upstash-hosted model allows you to upsert and query with raw text data
instead of sparse vectors.

In our SDKs and REST APIs, sparse vectors are represented with two arrays of equal
sizes: A 32-bit integer array for indices of the non-zero valued dimensions, and
a 32-bit float array for the values of the non-zero valued dimensions.

```python
from upstash_vector import Index, Vector
from upstash_vector.types import SparseVector

index = Index(
    url="UPSTASH_VECTOR_REST_URL",
    token="UPSTASH_VECTOR_REST_TOKEN",
)

# For indexes created with custom sparse embedding models
index.upsert(
    vectors=[
        Vector(
            id="id-0",
            sparse_vector=SparseVector([123, 2224, 55001], [0.95, 0.83, 0.82]),
            metadata={"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiconductor"},
        ),
    ]
)

results = index.query(
    sparse_vector=SparseVector([123, 5123], [0.75, 0.15]),
    top_k=5,
    include_metadata=True,
)

# For indexes created with Upstash-hosted sparse embedding models
index.upsert(
    vectors=[
        Vector(
            id="id-0",
            data="A semiconductor is a material that is between the conductor and insulator in ability to conduct electrical current.",
            metadata={"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiconductor"},
        ),
    ]
)

results = index.query(
    data="Is semiconductor an insulator?",
    top_k=5,
    include_metadata=True,
)
```

for the more information regarding customizing queries, and Upsthash-hosted sparse
embedding models.

## Using Hybrid Indexes

Go to [Upstash Console](https://console.upstash.com) to create a hybrid index.

While creating the index, you can choose between doing the dense and sparse vector
embeddings yourself, or use one of the Upstash-hosted
[dense and sparse embedding models](https://upstash.com/docs/vector/features/embeddingmodels#models)
to do it for you.

Using an Upstash-hosted model allows you to upsert and query with raw text data
instead of dense and sparse vectors.

```python
from upstash_vector import Index, Vector
from upstash_vector.types import SparseVector

index = Index(
    url="UPSTASH_VECTOR_REST_URL",
    token="UPSTASH_VECTOR_REST_TOKEN",
)

# For indexes created with custom dense and sparse embedding models
index.upsert(
    vectors=[
        Vector(
            id="id-0",
            vector=[0.01, 0.90, 0.95, ...],
            sparse_vector=SparseVector([123, 2224, 55001], [0.95, 0.83, 0.82]),
            metadata={"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiconductor"},
        ),
    ]
)

results = index.query(
    vector=[0.15, 0.88, 0.94, ...],
    sparse_vector=SparseVector([123, 5123], [0.75, 0.15]),
    top_k=5,
    include_metadata=True,
)

# For indexes created with Upstash-hosted sparse embedding models
index.upsert(
    vectors=[
        Vector(
            id="id-0",
            data="A semiconductor is a material that is between the conductor and insulator in ability to conduct electrical current.",
            metadata={"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiconductor"},
        ),
    ]
)

results = index.query(
    data="Is semiconductor an insulator?",
    top_k=5,
    include_metadata=True,
)
```

See [Hybrid Indexes](https://upstash.com/docs/vector/features/hybridindexes) documentation
for the more information regarding customizing queries, and using different fusion algorithms to
rerank dense and sparse search results.

## Indexing Wikipedia, Again

We have also updated the [Wikipedia Semantic Search](https://wikipedia-semantic-search.vercel.app)
demo by indexing Wikipedia articles again, this time with hybrid indexes, using different
dense and sparse embedding models. You can perform dense, sparse, or hybrid
search queries over it and compare the results yourself.

## Closing Words

Whether your data is better represented as dense, sparse, or hybrid vectors, these
new index types give you the tools to build more efficient and accurate applications.
