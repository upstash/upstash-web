Welcome! Today, we'll create our very own URL shortener using NestJS and Redis. If you've ever surprised at the simplicity of popular services like [TinyURL](https://tinyurl.com/app) and wondered how they transform long URLs into compact links, you're in the right place.

The concept is quite straightforward: users provide a lengthy URL, and our system assigns a unique identifier, in this case, a simple UUID, to represent it. This unique pairing is then stored as a key-value duo in our Redis database. But why bother with URL shorteners?

URL shorteners aren't just about brevity; they significantly enhance the sharing experience. Whether you're sharing links on social media or simplifying URLs for ease of use, this project has practical applications.

## Example key-value

### Understanding the Structure

Let's break down the key-value structure that combines a (UUID) with user information that we are going to store in our redis db:

```bash
[UUID]:[userId|userName] -> longUrl
7deb2726:hezarfen -> https://upstash.com/
```
- [UUID]: A unique identifier for each entry.
- [userId|userName]: Information about the user associated with the shortened URL.
- longUrl: The original URL that has been shortened.


First things first, let's set up a [Redis](https://console.upstash.com/redis). Head over to Upstash Redis Console to get your keys, which will look something like this:

```sh
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL="https://us1-XXX-38101.upstash.io"
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN="AZTVACQXXXVhOTktYzI0Mi0XXXM4ZmQzMjI3NDY0NTZmNDXXXYjQ0NGY4MGYwNDI="
```

## Env key setup

```sh
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL="https://us1-XXX-38101.upstash.io"
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN="AZTVACQXXXVhOTktYzI0Mi0XXXM4ZmQzMjI3NDY0NTZmNDXXXYjQ0NGY4MGYwNDI="
```

With the grunt work behind us, give yourself a well-deserved pat on the back. Now, let's dive into the juicy part.

## Setting up our NestJS

Let's first clone the starter repo:

```bs
git clone https://github.com/nestjs/typescript-starter.git project
cd project
```

And, install `@upstash/redis` and some depedencies:

```bs
npm i @upstash/redis @nestjs/config nanoid
```

We need `@upstash/redis` to store our shortened urls and `@nestjs/config` to load env files into our project.

Here is our file structure:

```bash
ðŸ“¦src
 â”£ ðŸ“‚lib
 â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“œredis-client.ts
 â”£ ðŸ“œapp.controller.ts
 â”£ ðŸ“œapp.module.ts
 â”£ ðŸ“œapp.service.ts
 â”— ðŸ“œmain.ts
 ðŸ“œ.env
```

Before move on let's update our `.env` as follows:

```bash
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL="https://XXXX-39281.upstash.io"
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN="AZXXXgNzYzMDhjYTItODQ4XXX4NTktOThmZWRiZjgzODNlMjM4XXXNmU4NDc0Njk0YWExOXXXFlZGU="
```

And, now it's time to make our `redis-client.ts` this is our entry file to our redis instance.

```ts
import { Redis } from "@upstash/redis";

export const createRedisClient = (restUrl: string, restToken: string) => {
  const redis = new Redis({
    url: restUrl,
    token: restToken,
  });
  return redis;
};
```

In NestJS since we can't access env keys directly within our function we have to pass it from the top when we load the env keys with `@nestjs/config`. To be able to use `@nestjs/config` we have to add it into
our import in `app.module.ts`.

```ts
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';
import { AppController } from './app.controller';
import { AppService } from './app.service';
import { ConfigModule } from '@nestjs/config';

@Module({
  imports: [ConfigModule.forRoot()],
  controllers: [AppController],
  providers: [AppService],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

NestJS has opiniated way of doing things. `.module.ts` files are similar to barel import files. They control what you import from or export to a specific module. As you can see we are also passing
our `app.controller.ts` and `app.service.ts` which we'll get to it in a second.

Now that we've successfully integrated the modules, let's delve into the functionality of service files and explore the process of injecting environment keys into `app.service.ts`.

```ts
import { Injectable } from '@nestjs/common';

@Injectable()
export class AppService {
  getHello(): string {
    return 'Hello World!';
  }
}
```

NestJS uses decorators extensively for abstraction. When we apply the `@Injectable` decorator, it signals that other packages can now inject this module into their runtime. With this foundation, let's proceed to inject our environment keys.

```ts
@Injectable()
export class AppService {
   constructor(private configService: ConfigService) {}

  getRedis(): Redis {
    const restUrl = this.configService.get<string>('UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL');
    const restToken = this.configService.get<string>(
      'UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN',
    );
    return createRedisClient(restUrl, restToken);
  }

  getHello(): string {
    return 'Hello World!';
  }
}
```

NestJS adopts a developer-friendly approach by favoring Dependency Injection over explicit imports/exports. This streamlined method is how we easily imported environment keys into our Redis client.

Now, let's bring our first actual function `setShortUrlToCache`.

```ts
export const UUID_LENGTH = 5;
const EIGHT_HOUR_IN_SEC = 3600 * 8;
export const EIGHT_HOUR_IN_MS = EIGHT_HOUR_IN_SEC * 1000;

export type ShortLinkCacheValues = {
  createadAt: number; //Date.now()
  expiredAt: number; //Date.now()
  actualLink: string;
  k: string;
};

async setShortUrlToCache(
    linkToShorten: string,
    expirationTime = EIGHT_HOUR_IN_SEC,
    userId: string,
  ) {
    const pathKey = `${nanoid(UUID_LENGTH)}:${userId}`;

    const payload: ShortLinkCacheValues = {
      createadAt: Date.now(),
      expiredAt: Date.now() + EIGHT_HOUR_IN_MS,
      actualLink: linkToShorten,
      k: pathKey,
    };
    const res = await this.getRedis().set<ShortLinkCacheValues>(
      pathKey,
      payload,
      {
        ex: expirationTime,
      },
    );
    if (res) {
      return pathKey;
    }
  }
```

Since we are essentially in a class, we can use `this` to access other internal methods like `this.getRedis()`.
This function requests a link to shorten, an optional expiration time, and a userId to easily identify shortened URLs.
Then, We create a UUID using nanoid and the userId: `${nanoid(UUID_LENGTH)}:${userId}`, and then call `redis.set` with the given `pathKey`, `payload`, and `ex`.
If the set operation is successful, we return `pathKey` to the user so they can later retrieve their full URL.

Now, we need two more method to get single shortened urls and all the shortened urls with associated user.

```ts
async getShortUrlFromCache(pathKey: string) {
    const res = await this.getRedis().get<ShortLinkCacheValues>(pathKey);
    return res;
  }

  async getAllShortUrlsFromCacheForUser(userId: string) {
    const keys = await this.getRedis().keys(`*${userId}*`);
    if (Boolean(keys.length)) {
      const listOfUrls = await this.getRedis().mget<ShortLinkCacheValues[]>(
        ...keys,
      );
      return listOfUrls;
    }
  }
```

The first method is straightforward: we pass the pathKey and retrieve the full URL along with additional metadata.
The second method takes a userId, attempts to retrieve all keys containing that userId using `*userId*`, and then calls redis.mget to fetch all of them simultaneously.

Now, we need a controller file to expose those services to endpoints

```ts
@Controller()
export class AppController {
  constructor(private readonly appService: AppService) {}

  @Post('/shorten')
  shorterUrl(@Req() req: Request) {
    const queries = req.query;
    const { linkToShorten, userId } = queries as unknown as {
      linkToShorten: string;
      expire: number;
      userId: string;
    };
    return this.appService.setShortUrlToCache(linkToShorten, null, userId);
  }

  @Get('/get-shortened-url/:id')
  getShortenedUrl(@Req() req: Request) {
    return this.appService.getShortUrlFromCache(req.params['id']);
  }

  @Get('/get-all-shortened-url/:id')
  getAllShortenedUrl(@Req() req: Request) {
    return this.appService.getAllShortUrlsFromCacheForUser(req.params['id']);
  }
}
```

As mentioned earlier, NestJS heavily relies on decorators, such as `@Post` and `@Get`. If you've worked with Spring or .Net, the controller structure might seem familiar.

In our case, we use `@Post()` to define an endpoint, in this instance, /shorter. We then use @Req() req: Request to access query parameters. After that, the process is straightforward â€“ we call `this.appService.setShortUrlToCache`, which we injected earlier through constructor injection, and return the pathKey to the user.

If you wanna test `/shorten`. Use this example cURL,

```bs
curl -X POST "http://localhost:3000/shorten?linktoShorten=https://upstash.com&userId=hezarfen"
```

In return you will get something like this

```bs
Pn7d0:hezarfen
```

To get back our full url we simply do this

```bs
curl http://localhost:3000/get-shortened-url/Pn7d0:hezarfen
```

In return you will get something like this

```ts
{"createadAt":1700743946597,"expiredAt":1700772746597,"k":"Pn7d0:Oz"}
```

To get every associated long url:

```bs
curl http://localhost:3000/get-all-shortened-url/hezarfen
```

In return you will get something like this

```ts
[
  { createadAt: 1700744195441, expiredAt: 1700772995441, k: "7KgZF:hezarfen" },
  { createadAt: 1700744179512, expiredAt: 1700772979512, k: "e0b0S:hezarfen" },
  { createadAt: 1700744207376, expiredAt: 1700773007376, k: "hMlNs:hezarfen" },
];
```
