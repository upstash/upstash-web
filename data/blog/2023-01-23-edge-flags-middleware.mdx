Edge-Flags allow you to easily manage feature flags for your serverless applications. It's built on top of Upstash Redis with powerful geolocation rules.
Today I'll show you a very simple example of how you can use Edge-Flags in a Next.js middleware to rewrite requests based on the location of the user.

## Create the flag

In our example app we only want to make content available to our users in the EU, so we'll [create](https://console.upstash.com/redis?new=true) a new Redis database and then go to the [edge-flags](https://console.upstash.com/edge-flags) page.
Select the created database and the `production` environment.

Then we can create a new flag named `eu-countries` and add the all countries within the EU.

## Setup and install the packages

1. If you don't have an existing Next.js app, you can create one with `npx create-next-app` and install the `@upstash/edge-flags` and `@upstash/redis` packages:

```sh-session
$ npm install @upstash/edge-flags @upstash/redis
```

2. Create a new file `middleware.ts` in the root of your project and add the following code:

```ts title="/middleware.ts"
import { NextRequest, NextResponse } from "next/server";
import { Redis } from "@upstash/redis";
import { Client as EdgeFlags } from "@upstash/edge-flags";

const edgeFlags = new EdgeFlags({ redis: Redis.fromEnv() });
export default async function middleware(
  req: NextRequest
): Promise<NextResponse> {
  const enabled = await edgeFlags
    .getFlag("eu-countries", req.geo ?? {})
    .catch((err) => {
      console.error(err);
      return false;
    });

  if (!enabled) {
    const url = new URL(req.url);
    url.pathname = "/blocked";
    return NextResponse.rewrite(url);
  }

  return NextResponse.next();
}

export const config = {
  matcher: "/",
};
```

3. Create a very sophisticated `/blocked` page

```tsx title="app/blocked/page.tsx"
export default function Page() {
  return <div> You are not in the EU</div>;
}
```

Now all that's left is to deploy the project to Vercel:

```sh-session
$ npx vercel
```

Make sure to add the environment variables to Vercel either by copying them from the [Upstash console](https://console.upstash.com/redis) or by using the [Upstash integration](https://vercel.com/integrations/upstash).

## Test it out

<Note title="Geolocation in development">
  Geolocation data is not avaiable when developing locally. You need to actually
  deploy the app to Vercel to test it out.
</Note>

Now you can test it out by visiting the index page of your app. If you're in the EU you should see the content, otherwise you'll be redirected to the `/blocked` page.
