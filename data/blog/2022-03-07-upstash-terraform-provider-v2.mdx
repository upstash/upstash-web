It has been some time since we released our very first version of Upstash Terraform Provider, which helped developers automate their Redis database management.
Since then, we have worked on and advanced our products, even adding new ones to our arsenal!

Now, our provider v1.0.0 is publicly available in [the terraform marketplace](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/upstash/upstash/latest).

### What is new in Terraform Provider V1.0.0 ?

Since we announced our [very first version of Terraform Provider](https://blog.upstash.com/redis-terraform), a lot has improved!

In this new version of the provider; we have expanded the capabilities of our provider with the new functionalities of the newly announced [v2 api](https://blog.upstash.com/management-api-v2) and the team functionalities that were not implemented in the previous version of the Terraform Provider.

As a result, creating the infrastructure of your applications has become automated and much more robust.

#### Here is what are new:

- Kafka Topic Creation and Management
- Kafka Cluster Creation and Management
- Team Creation and Management

### Configuration

If you want to use the plugin, just configure your provider as such:

```
terraform {
  required_providers {
    upstash = {
      source = "upstash/upstash"
      version = "1.0.0"
    }
  }
}
```

```
provider "upstash" {
  email = "EMAIL"
  api_key  = "API_KEY"
}
```

:::note
You can get an API_KEY from the Upstash Console. Also EMAIL is the email you registered for Upstash.

### Creating Resources

```
resource "upstash_redis_database" "exampleDB" {
  database_name = "TerraformDB"
  region = "eu-west-1"
  tls = false
  multizone = false
}
```

#### Upstash Kafka Cluster

```
resource "upstash_kafka_cluster" "exampleCluster" {
  cluster_name = "TerraformCluster"
  region = "eu-west-1"
  multizone = false
}
```

```
resource "upstash_kafka_topic" "exampleKafkaTopic" {
  topic_name = "TerraformTopic"
  partitions = 1
  retention_time = 625135
  retention_size = 725124
  max_message_size = 829213
  cleanup_policy = "delete"
  cluster_id = resource.upstash_kafka_cluster.exampleKafkaCluster.cluster_id
}
```
