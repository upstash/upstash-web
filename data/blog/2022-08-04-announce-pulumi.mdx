Upon request from our community, we have developed Pulumi Provider for Upstash Redis and Kafka, which is now publicly available.

[Pulumi](https://www.pulumi.com) is an automated provisioning tool similar to Terraform but it leverages the functionalities of modern programming languages such as TypeScript, Go and Python.
This way, you can create conditional resources, multiple resources via loops and so on, enabling for more dynamic and maintainable IAC.

### Creating your infrastructure as code with your favorite languages

#### Create pulumi template

```shell
pulumi new <your_language>
```

#### TypeScript / JavaScript

```js
const createdDb = new upstash.RedisDatabase("mydb", {
    databaseName: "pulumi-ts-db",
    region: "eu-west-1",
    tls: true
})
```

#### Go

```go
createdCluster, _ := upstash.NewKafkaCluster(ctx, "exampleCluster", &upstash.KafkaClusterArgs{
    ClusterName: pulumi.String("pulumi-go-cluster"),
    Multizone:   pulumi.Bool(false),
    Region:      pulumi.String("eu-west-1"),
})
```

#### Python

```python
created_team = upstash.Team(
    resource_name="myTeam",
    team_name="pulumi team",
    copy_cc=True,
    team_members={
        "<owner_email>": "owner",
        "<second_email>": "admin"
    }
)

```

#### CRUD your resources: `pulumi up`

### Future Work

We want to keep the developer experience easy and intuitive. Hence, we will keep our tools up-to-date with our services.
As an example, QStash resources will soon be added
to both Terraform and Pulumi providers.

### Closing Words

For resource creations with different languages, you can have a look at [our repo](https://github.com/upstash/upstash-pulumi-provider/tree/master/examples).
