In this tutorial, we will explore how to build an image similarity search engine using [CLIP(Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining)](https://openai.com/blog/clip) and [Pinecone](https://www.pinecone.io/), a vector database for efficient similarity search. <br/>

## Introduction

CLIP is a powerful neural network trained on a diverse set of (image, text) pairs, allowing it to understand and encode both visual and textual information. Pinecone, on the other hand, is a scalable vector database designed for storing and searching high-dimensional vectors efficiently. By combining CLIP's image embeddings with Pinecone's similarity search capabilities, we can create a robust image similarity search engine.

## Prerequisites

To follow this tutorial, you will need:

- A [Pinecone](https://www.pinecone.io/) account. If you don't have one, you can [sign up for free](https://www.pinecone.io/start/).
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) 3.6 or higher
- [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) installed
- [Pillow](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) installed
- [Pinecone Python Module](https://docs.pinecone.io/docs/python-client) installed
- [Numpy](https://numpy.org/install/) installed
- [Transformers](https://huggingface.co/transformers/installation.html) installed 

You can install the required packages using the following command.

```bash 
pip install torch pillow pinecone-client transformers numpy
```

## Getting Started

First, let's import the required libraries and initialize the CLIP model:

```python
import pinecone
import torch
import numpy as np
from PIL import Image
from transformers import CLIPModel
import os
from torchvision import transforms

# Initialize Pinecone client
pinecone.init(api_key="<your_api_key>", environment="<your_environment_name>")

# Connect to your Pinecone index
index = pinecone.Index("<your_index_name>")

# Load the CLIP model
model = CLIPModel.from_pretrained("openai/clip-vit-base-patch32")

```

## Image Embeddings and Indexing

We'll define a function to transform images into embeddings using the CLIP model and then upsert these embeddings into the Pinecone index:

```python
# Define image preprocessing
preprocess = transforms.Compose([
    transforms.Resize((224, 224)),
    transforms.ToTensor(),
    transforms.Normalize((0.5, 0.5, 0.5), (0.5, 0.5, 0.5))
])

# Define a function to transform an image into an embedding
def transform_image(image):
    image = preprocess(image)
    image = image.unsqueeze(0)
    with torch.no_grad():
        features = model.get_image_features(pixel_values=image)
    embedding = features.squeeze().cpu().numpy()
    return embedding.astype(np.float32)

# Upsert image embeddings into the Pinecone index
image_dir = "./images"
for filename in os.listdir(image_dir):
    if filename.endswith(".jpg"):
        image_path = os.path.join(image_dir, filename)
        image = Image.open(image_path)
        embedding = transform_image(image)

        id = filename

        vector = [{"values": embedding, "metadata": {}, "id": id }]
        index.upsert(vector, namespace='ot')

        print(f"Upserted image {filename} with ID {filename}")
```

## Image Similarity Search

Once the images are indexed, we can perform similarity searches using a query image:

```python
# Define a function to query similar images
query_image_path = "./query_image.jpg"

# Preprocess query image
query_image = Image.open(query_image_path)
query_embedding = transform_image(query_image)  # Squeeze the tensor to remove batch dimension

# The top_k parameter controls the number of results to retrieve
top_k = 5
query_vector = query_embedding.tolist()
result = index.query(vector=query_vector, namespace='ot', top_k=top_k, include_metadata=True, include_values=True)

# Print results
print(f"Query image: {query_image_path}")
print(f"Top {top_k} results:")

for i, res in enumerate(result.matches):
    print(f"Rank {i + 1}: ID={res.id}, score={res.score}")
```

You should get a result similar to the following:

```bash
Top 5 results:
Rank 1: ID=Shanghai skyline.jpg, score=0.902134657
Rank 2: ID=Between Buildings.jpg, score=0.875016212
Rank 3: ID=Airplane between.jpg, score=0.863566935
Rank 4: ID=Building.jpg, score=0.838529587
Rank 5: ID=Two people.jpg, score=0.837375104
```

## Bonus

You can fill the field to the Pinecone index to get more information about the images.
Which is also useful for filtering the results. [More info](https://docs.pinecone.io/docs/metadata-filtering) <br/>

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we have learned how to build an image similarity search engine using CLIP and Pinecone. By leveraging CLIP's powerful image embeddings and Pinecone's efficient similarity search capabilities, we can quickly find visually similar images based on a query image. <br/>
