In this tutorial, you will learn how to connect to Upstash Redis database using go-redis client and monitor performance of your app using distributed tracing.

## What is go-redis?

[go-redis](https://redis.uptrace.dev/) is a popular Redis client for Golang. Out of the box, it supports Redis Server, Sentinel, and Cluster.

To connect to Upstash Redis database, use the following code:

```go
package main

import (
	"context"
	"fmt"

	"github.com/go-redis/redis/v8"
)

func main() {
	ctx := context.Background()

	opt, _ := redis.ParseURL("<connection-string-from-Upstash>")
	client := redis.NewClient(opt)

	if err := client.Set(ctx, "foo", "bar", 0); err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
	fmt.Println(client.Get(ctx, "foo").Result())
}
```

To execute arbitrary commands, you can also use an alternative API:

```go
val, err := rdb.Do(ctx, "get", "key").Result()
if err != nil {
	if err == redis.Nil {
		fmt.Println("key does not exists")
		return
	}
	panic(err)
}
```

You can use go-redis to [cache](https://redis.uptrace.dev/guide/go-redis-cache.html) data or [rate-limit](https://redis.uptrace.dev/guide/go-redis-rate-limiting.html) requests to your API. To learn more about the client, see [Redis Golang](https://redis.uptrace.dev/guide/go-redis.html) documentation.

## What is distributed tracing?

[Distributed tracing](https://opentelemetry.uptrace.dev/guide/distributed-tracing.html) allows to observe requests as they propagate through distributed systems, especially those built using a microservices architecture.

Tracing allows to follow requests as they travel through distributed systems. You get a full context of what is different, what is broken, and which logs & errors are relevant.

## What is OpenTelemetry?

[OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.uptrace.dev/) is a vendor-neutral standard that allows you to collect and export [traces](https://opentelemetry.uptrace.dev/guide/distributed-tracing.html), [logs](https://opentelemetry.uptrace.dev/guide/logs.html), and [metrics](https://opentelemetry.uptrace.dev/guide/metrics.html).

Otel allows developers to collect and export telemetry data in a vendor agnostic way. With OpenTelemetry, you can [instrument](https://opentelemetry.uptrace.dev/instrumentations/) your application once and then add or change vendors without changing the instrumentation, for example, here is a list [popular DataDog alternatives](https://get.uptrace.dev/compare/datadog-competitors.html) that support OpenTelemetry.

OpenTelemetry is available for most programming languages and provides interoperability across different languages and environments.

## Tracing and go-redis

go-redis comes with an OpenTelemetry instrumentation called [redisotel](https://github.com/go-redis/redis/tree/master/extra/redisotel) that is distributed as a separate module:

```shell
go get github.com/go-redis/redis/extra/redisotel/v8
```

To instrument Redis client, you need to add the hook provided by redisotel:

```go
import (
    "github.com/go-redis/redis/v8"
    "github.com/go-redis/redis/extra/redisotel/v8"
)

rdb := redis.NewClient(&redis.Options{...})

rdb.AddHook(redisotel.NewTracingHook())
```

To make tracing work, you must pass the active [trace context](https://opentelemetry.uptrace.dev/guide/go-tracing.html#context) to go-redis commands, for example:

```go
ctx := req.Context()
val, err := rdb.Get(ctx, "key").Result()
```

To learn more about redisotel, see [Monitoring Go Redis Performance and Errors](https://redis.uptrace.dev/guide/go-redis-monitoring.html).

## Uptrace

[Uptrace](https://uptrace.dev/) is an open source [DataDog competitor](https://get.uptrace.dev/compare/datadog-competitors.html) with an intuitive query builder, rich dashboards, automatic alerts, and integrations for most languages and frameworks.

You can [install Uptrace](https://get.uptrace.dev/guide/opentelemetry-tracing-tool.html) by downloading a DEB/RPM package or a pre-compiled binary.

As expected, redisotel creates [spans](https://opentelemetry.uptrace.dev/guide/distributed-tracing.html#spans) for processed Redis commands and records any errors as they occur. Here is how the collected information is displayed at Uptrace:

You can find a runnable example at [GitHub](https://github.com/go-redis/redis/tree/master/example/otel).

## What's next?

Next, you can install more OpenTelemetry [instrumentations](https://opentelemetry.uptrace.dev/instrumentations/?lang=go) to monitor other aspects of the app, for example, [Gin](https://opentelemetry.uptrace.dev/instrumentations/go-gin.html) or [Go gRPC](https://opentelemetry.uptrace.dev/instrumentations/go-grpc.html).

You can also learn about OpenTelemetry [Tracing API](https://opentelemetry.uptrace.dev/guide/go-tracing.html) and [Metrics API](https://opentelemetry.uptrace.dev/guide/go-metrics.html) to create your own instrumentations.
