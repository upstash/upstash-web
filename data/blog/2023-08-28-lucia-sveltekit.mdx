After our last guide on the Upstash blog scored a spot on the **[Bytes newsletter](https://bytes.dev/archives/209)**, I thought we'd keep the SvelteKit party going.

As a Svelte super fan, I'm seeing more and more people jumping on board every day — and it makes me incredibly excited for the future.

One of the tools that’s still flying under the radar is [Lucia](https://lucia-auth.com/).

In this guide I’m going to show you how to get authentication up and running with Lucia. We will be using PlanetScale for our database needs, and Upstash Redis to handle sessions.

Below is a screenshot of our end goal for this guide. You can find the example repository [here](https://github.com/upstash/examples/tree/main/examples/sveltekit-lucia-redis).

![redis-lucia-auth-signin.jpg](/blog/lucia-sveltekit/redis-lucia-auth-signin.jpg)

This guide will be in SvelteKit, but since Lucia supports any framework, most of this guide can easily be applied to any popular framework out there.

## What is Lucia?

Simply put, Lucia is a library for TypeScript that makes handling users and sessions a piece of cake.
Originally, this library was created for SvelteKit, but it has continually evolved and is now versatile enough to play well with just about any framework.


What's so awesome about Lucia is how it equips you with everything you need to manage the complexity of authentication without sacrificing user experience.
Think of Lucia as a set of primitives — it’s up to you how you want to structure your code and handle the user experience.
Lucia has a few key parts that are important to understand:

**[Middleware](https://lucia-auth.com/basics/handle-requests)** allows Lucia to read the request and response for different frameworks and runtime.

Here's an example of how you would configure middleware:

```ts
import { lucia } from 'lucia';
import { node } from 'lucia/middleware';
// import { nextjs } from "lucia/middleware";
// import { h3 } from "lucia/middleware";

export const auth = lucia({
	env: 'DEV', // "PROD" if deployed to HTTPS
	middleware: node()
});
```

**[Database adapters](https://lucia-auth.com/database-adapters)** allow Lucia to store and retrieve users and sessions. By providing an adapter Lucia knows how to query for these types. There are 2 types of adapters; regular adapters, and session adapters. In this particular guide we’re going to use a mySQL database hosted on PlanetScale to store our users, and a Redis instance hosted on Upstash to handle sessions.

Here's an example of how you would configure a database adapter:

```ts
import { lucia } from 'lucia';
import { prisma } from '@lucia-auth/adapter-prisma';
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client';

const client = new PrismaClient();

const auth = lucia({
	env: 'DEV',
	adapter: prisma(client)
});
```

With that background info, let’s jump right in.

## **Prerequisites**

To get up and running with the app and following along you need:

- A fundamental understanding of SvelteKit. Handling forms and routing is a plus.
- Basic familiarity with Drizzle ORM.
- An account and database on PlanetScale.
- Access to a Redis instance for example, [Upstash Redis](https://upstash.com).

## **Getting started**

For the sake of efficiency, we won't be creating the entire application from scratch.

Instead, you can clone the `sveltekit-lucia-redis` directory from the [Upstash examples repo](https://github.com/upstash/examples) to follow along.

After downloading the repository, navigate into the application using the `cd` command and install the dependencies via your preferred package manager and set the `.env` variables by duplicating `.env.example`.

### Understanding the key parts

Here’s a quick rundown of all the important parts.

- `src/lib/server/auth/index.ts` - Here’s where we configure Lucia.
- `src/lib/server/drizzle` - Drizzle helps us to easily create a mySQL schema which we can conveniently push to PlanetScale using Drizzle Kit.
- `src/lib/server/planetscale` - Exports the Upstash Client which we use in our Lucia adapter config to manage users.
- `src/lib/server/upstash` - Exports the Upstash Client which we use in our Lucia adapter config to manage sessions.

## **Breaking down the code**

### Configuring Lucia

The first thing we need to do is configure Lucia. We can do this by creating a new file in `src/lib/server/auth/index.ts`.

```ts title="src/lib/server/auth/index.ts"
import { lucia } from 'lucia';
import { dev } from '$app/environment';
import { sveltekit } from 'lucia/middleware';
import { planetscale } from '@lucia-auth/adapter-mysql';
import { ps } from '../planetscale';

export enum PROVIDER_ID {
	EMAIL = 'email'
}

export const auth = lucia({
	adapter: {
		user: planetscale(ps, {
			user: 'users',
			key: 'keys',
			/**
			 * Sessions are handled by Upstash Redis.
			 */
			session: null
		})
	},
	middleware: sveltekit(),
	env: dev ? 'DEV' : 'PROD',
	getUserAttributes: (data) => {
		return {
			userId: data.id,
			email: data.email
		};
	}
});

export type Auth = typeof auth;
```

Here's a quick rundown of what's going on here:

We import the `lucia` function from the `lucia` package to set up the configuration for Lucia.

The first thing we do is configure the `adapter` property. This is where we tell Lucia how to handle users and sessions.

We set the session property to `null` because we want to use Redis to handle sessions. If you would use the string `'session'` here instead, Lucia would use the same adapter for both users and sessions (these strings correspond to the tables in your database).

Don't worry about the session adapter for now, we'll get to that later.

In the `middleware` property we can let Lucia know that we're using SvelteKit. This will allow Lucia to read the request and response objects.

Take note of the exported `Auth` type. This is the type of our `auth` object. We'll need this to set up the [SvelteKit locals](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/types#app-locals).

## Getting great type inference with Lucia

Lucia is written in TypeScript, so you get great type inference out of the box. Let's make sure SvelteKit knows about the `Auth` type we just created.

Open up your `app.d.ts` file and add the following:

```ts title="src/app.d.ts"
import type { AuthRequest, Session, User } from 'lucia';
import type { Auth as LuciaAuth } from '$lib/server/auth';

declare global {
	namespace App {
		// interface Error {}
		interface Locals {
			auth: AuthRequest;
			session: Session | null;
		}
		interface PageData {
			user?: User;
		}
		// interface Platform {}
	}
}

/// <reference types="lucia" />
declare global {
	namespace Lucia {
		type Auth = LuciaAuth;
		type DatabaseUserAttributes = {
			email: string;
		};
		type DatabaseSessionAttributes = {};
	}
}

export {};
```

By adding the `Auth` type to the `Lucia` namespace, we can now access the `auth` object from the `locals` object in our SvelteKit routes.

But also anything imported from Lucia will now have the correct types as well.

Now that we have these types, we can set up `hooks.server.ts`. This is where we’ll bind the `AuthRequest` and `Session` object to the current request.

This will make it easily accessible on the server through `locals`.

```ts title="src/hooks.server.ts"
import { auth } from '$lib/server';
import type { Handle } from '@sveltejs/kit';
import { sequence } from '@sveltejs/kit/hooks';

const auth_handle: Handle = async ({ event, resolve }) => {
	event.locals.auth = auth.handleRequest(event);
	event.locals.session = await event.locals.auth.validate();

	return resolve(event);
};

export const handle = sequence(auth_handle);
```

We'll also import `sequence` which is a helper function that allows us to run multiple hooks in sequence. This will be useful later on when we try to protect our routes.

### Creating the user model

Now that we have Lucia configured, we can create our user model.

We'll use Drizzle ORM, since it's all hot and happening right now.

<div class="max-w-sm mx-auto my-8 rounded-sm">
    <img src="/blog/lucia-sveltekit/drizzle-orm-meme.jpeg" alt="drizzle-orm-meme" />
</div>

_And their memes are on point. Just look at this one._

Before you can continue, you need to create a database on PlanetScale. And setup the Drizzle config file. This will help the Drizzle CLI to connect to your database.

```ts title="drizzle.config.ts"
import type { Config } from 'drizzle-kit';
import dotenv from 'dotenv';

dotenv.config();

const username = process.env.DATABASE_USERNAME;
const password = process.env.DATABASE_PASSWORD;
const host = process.env.DATABASE_HOST;
const db = process.env.DATABASE_NAME;
const connectionString = `mysql://${username}:${password}@${host}/${db}?ssl={"rejectUnauthorized":true}`;

export default {
	schema: './src/lib/server/drizzle/schema/index.ts',
	driver: 'mysql2',
	dbCredentials: {
		connectionString: connectionString
	}
} satisfies Config;
```

Because we're using the mySQL adapter, Lucia expects our user model to have a specific structure. You can find more information about this in the [docs](https://lucia-auth.com/database-adapters/mysql2).

Place the following code in `src/lib/server/drizzle/schema/index.ts`.

```ts title="src/lib/server/drizzle/schema/index.ts"
import {
	mysqlTable,
	index,
	unique,
	varchar,
	datetime,
	mysqlEnum,
	bigint,
	timestamp,
	int
} from 'drizzle-orm/mysql-core';
import { relations } from 'drizzle-orm';

export const users = mysqlTable(
	'users',
	{
		id: varchar('id', { length: 255 }).primaryKey(),
		createdAt: timestamp('createdAt').defaultNow().onUpdateNow().notNull(),
		updatedAt: timestamp('updatedAt').defaultNow().onUpdateNow().notNull(),
		email: varchar('email', { length: 191 }).notNull()
	},
	(table) => {
		return {
			idIdx: index('users_id_idx').on(table.id),
			userIdKey: unique('users_id_key').on(table.id)
		};
	}
);

export const keys = mysqlTable(
	'keys',
	{
		id: varchar('id', { length: 255 }).primaryKey(),
		hashedPassword: varchar('hashed_password', { length: 255 }),
		userId: varchar('user_id', { length: 255 }).notNull()
	},
	(table) => {
		return {
			userIdIdx: index('keys_user_id_idx').on(table.userId),
			keyIdKey: unique('keys_id_key').on(table.id)
		};
	}
);
```

And run `pnpm drizzle-kit push:mysql` to push the schema to PlanetScale.

Voila! You now have a user model that Lucia can use to manage users.

### Setting up session management

Now that we have our user model, we can set up session management.

We'll use Upstash Redis to handle sessions. You can sign up for a free account [here](https://upstash.com/).

![Upstash Dashboard](/blog/lucia-sveltekit/upstash-dashboard-new-redis.png)

Once you're in the dashboard, all you need to do is create a new database and copy the environment variables.

![Upstash Environment Variables](/blog/lucia-sveltekit/upstash-redis-env-variables.png)

Now add these variables to your `.env` file. And add the following to `src/lib/server/upstash/index.ts`.

```ts title="src/lib/server/upstash/index.ts"
import { UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN, UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL } from '$env/static/private';
import { Redis } from '@upstash/redis';

export const upstashClient = new Redis({
	url: UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL,
	token: UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN
});
```

Now remember when we configured Lucia, we set the `session` to `null`. This is because we want to use Redis to handle sessions. This is what our config looks like now:

```ts title="src/lib/server/auth/index.ts"
import { lucia } from 'lucia';
import { upstash } from '@lucia-auth/adapter-session-redis';
import { dev } from '$app/environment';
import { sveltekit } from 'lucia/middleware';
import { upstashClient } from '../upstash';
import { planetscale } from '@lucia-auth/adapter-mysql';
import { ps } from '../planetscale';

export enum PROVIDER_ID {
	EMAIL = 'email'
}

export const auth = lucia({
	adapter: {
		user: planetscale(ps, {
			user: 'users',
			key: 'keys',
			session: null
		}),
		// Instruct Lucia to use Upstash Redis for sessions
		session: upstash(upstashClient)
	},
	middleware: sveltekit(),
	env: dev ? 'DEV' : 'PROD',
	getUserAttributes: (data) => {
		return {
			userId: data.id,
			email: data.email
		};
	}
});

export type Auth = typeof auth;
```

Lucky for us, Lucia has an Upstash Redis adapter out of the box. So all we need to do is import it and pass it the Upstash client.

Now that was easy!

## **Creating the routes**

Now that we have Lucia configured, we can create our routes.

Create the following folders in `src/routes`. Don't worry about any files for now, we'll go over them in a bit.

- `src/routes/auth`
  - `src/routes/auth/signin`
  - `src/routes/auth/signup`
- `src/routes/app`

**Tip:** Having certain "features" under the same folder name or [group](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/advanced-routing#advanced-layouts-group) makes it easy to manage when doing redirects and protecting routes.

### Creating the signin page

Finally, we can do some front-end work! Let's start with the signin page.

Create a new file in `src/routes/auth/signin/+page.svelte`. I'm going to omit the styling for now, and focus on the functionality — but you can find the full code in the example repository.

```svelte title="src/routes/auth/signin/+page.svelte"
<script lang="ts">
	import { enhance } from '$app/forms';
	import { Button, Input, Label, PasswordInput } from '$lib/components/common';
	import type { ActionData } from './$types';

	export let form: ActionData;

	let loading = false;
	let email = '';
	let password = '';
</script>

<form
	method="POST"
	use:enhance={() => {
		loading = true;

		return async ({ update }) => {
			loading = false;

			update();
		};
	}}
>
	{#if form && form.error}
		<div class="p-2 mb-4 text-sm text-center text-red-900 bg-red-200 rounded-sm">
			Error: {form.error}
		</div>
	{/if}

	<div class="grid gap-2.5">
		<div class="grid gap-1">
			<Label for="email">Email</Label>
			<Input
				bind:value={email}
				name="email"
				placeholder="Email"
				type="email"
				autoCapitalize="none"
				autoComplete="email"
				autoCorrect="off"
				required={true}
			/>
		</div>

		<div class="grid gap-1">
			<Label for="password">Password</Label>
			<PasswordInput name="password" placeholder="Password" bind:value={password} />
		</div>

		<div class="mt-6 col-span-full">
			<Button type="submit" class="w-full" disabled={loading}>
				{#if loading}
					Loading...
				{:else}
					Sign in
				{/if}
			</Button>
		</div>
	</div>
</form>
```

The `use:enhance` action will progressively enhance the form, and allow us to show a loading state when the form is submitted. You can read more about enhance [here](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/form-actions#progressive-enhancement-use-enhance).

The rest of the code is pretty self-explanatory.

#### Handling the signin request

SvelteKit makes it incredibly easy to handle POST requests. All we need to do is create a file `+page.server.ts` in the same directory as the `+page.svelte` file and export a `actions` object with at least a `default` property.

```ts title="src/routes/auth/signin/+page.server.ts"
import { fail, redirect } from '@sveltejs/kit';
import type { PageServerLoad, Actions } from './$types';
import { PROVIDER_ID, auth } from '$lib/server';
import { LuciaError } from 'lucia';

export const actions = {
	/* our actions here */
};
```

Let's explore the key elements in this part of the file:

We've imported the `PROVIDER_ID` enum and `auth` from `src/lib/server/auth`, which we created earlier. This `auth` object contains all the methods we need to manage users and sessions.

Now let's take a look at the `actions` object. We can get the form data from the request object, and do some basic housekeeping.

```ts
actions = {
    default: async ({ request, locals }) => {
        const formData = await request.formData();
        const email = formData.get("email") as string;
        const password = formData.get("password") as string;
        const fields = [email, password];

        if (fields.some(field => !field)) {
            return fail(400, {
                error: "All fields are required"
            });
        }
```

Next, we'll try to sign in the user. If the user doesn't exist, or the password is incorrect, Lucia will throw an error. We've prepared for this event by catching the error and returning a 400 response along with an error message.

```ts
try {
	const user = await auth.useKey(PROVIDER_ID.EMAIL, email.toLowerCase(), password);

	const session = await auth.createSession({
		userId: user.userId,
		attributes: {}
	});

	locals.auth.setSession(session);
} catch (err) {
	if (
		err instanceof LuciaError &&
		(err.message === 'AUTH_INVALID_KEY_ID' || err.message === 'AUTH_INVALID_PASSWORD')
	) {
		return fail(400, {
			error: 'Incorrect username of password'
		});
	}

	return fail(400, {
		error: 'An unknown error occurred'
	});
}
```

If the user exists and the password is correct, we'll create a new session.

And finally, we'll redirect the user to the dashboard.

```ts
return redirect('/app');
```

As you can probably tell, Lucia abstracts away a lot of the complexity of authentication. All we need to do is call the right methods, and Lucia will handle the rest.

<div class="max-w-sm mx-auto my-8 rounded-sm">
    <img src="/blog/lucia-sveltekit/spongebob-magic.jpeg" alt="spongebob meme" />
</div>

No need to, hash passwords, create sessions, or manage cookies. Lucia does it all for us. And it's all type-safe!

### Creating the signup page

Create a new file in `src/routes/auth/signup/+page.svelte`.

The signup page is very similar to the signin page, so there's not much to explain here. The only difference is that we're asking for a password confirmation.

```svelte title="src/routes/auth/signup/+page.svelte"
<script lang="ts">
	import { enhance } from '$app/forms';
	import { Button, Input, Label, PasswordInput } from '$lib/components/common';
	import type { ActionData } from './$types';

	export let form: ActionData;

	let loading = false;
	let email = '';
	let password = '';
	let passwordConfirmation = '';
</script>

<form
	method="POST"
	use:enhance={() => {
		loading = true;

		return async ({ update }) => {
			loading = false;

			update();
		};
	}}
>
	{#if form && form.error}
		<div class="p-2 mb-4 text-sm text-center text-red-900 bg-red-200 rounded-sm">
			Error: {form.error}
		</div>
	{/if}

	<div class="grid gap-2.5">
		<div class="grid gap-1">
			<Label for="email">Email</Label>
			<Input
				bind:value={email}
				name="email"
				placeholder="Email"
				type="email"
				autoCapitalize="none"
				autoComplete="email"
				autoCorrect="off"
				required={true}
			/>
		</div>

		<div class="grid gap-1">
			<Label for="password">Password</Label>
			<PasswordInput name="password" placeholder="Password" bind:value={password} />
		</div>

		<div class="grid gap-1">
			<Label for="passwordConfirmation">Confirm password</Label>
			<PasswordInput
				name="passwordConfirmation"
				placeholder="Repeat password"
				bind:value={passwordConfirmation}
			/>
		</div>

		<div class="mt-6 col-span-full">
			<Button type="submit" class="w-full" disabled={loading}>
				{#if loading}
					Loading...
				{:else}
					Sign in
				{/if}
			</Button>
		</div>
	</div>
</form>
```

#### Handling the signup request

Create a new file in `src/routes/auth/signup/+page.server.ts`.

For the signup we will need to use a similar pattern as with our signup form but there will be few differences starting from data retrieval from the form, field's validation up to the point of creating the user and handling already existing users.

The imports are the same as with the signin page, so we'll skip that part.

We'll start by getting the form data from the request object, and do some basic housekeeping. We'll also check if the passwords match.

```ts
const formData = await request.formData();
const email = formData.get('email') as string;
const password = formData.get('password') as string;
const passwordConfirmation = formData.get('passwordConfirmation') as string;

const fields = [email, password, passwordConfirmation];

if (fields.some((field) => !field)) {
	return fail(400, {
		error: 'All fields are required'
	});
}

if (password !== passwordConfirmation) {
	return fail(400, {
		error: 'Passwords do not match'
	});
}
```

Next, we'll try to find the user by email using Drizzle ORM. If the user exists, we'll return a 400 response along with an error message.

```ts
try {
    const user = await db.query.users.findFirst({
        where: eq(schema.users.email, email.toLowerCase()),
    });

    if (user) {
        return fail(400, {
            error: "User with this email already exists"
        });
    }
```

If the user doesn't exist, we'll create a new user using Lucia.

```ts
const newUser = await auth.createUser({
	key: {
		providerId: PROVIDER_ID.EMAIL,
		providerUserId: email.toLowerCase(),
		password: password
	},
	attributes: {
		email
	}
});
```

And finally, we'll create a new session and redirect the user to the dashboard.

```ts
const session = await auth.createSession({
	userId: newUser.userId,
	attributes: {}
});

locals.auth.setSession(session);
```

Easy peasey lemon squeezy!

### Bonus: Creating the signout page

While we're at it, let's create an endpoint to sign out the user. Create a new file in `src/routes/auth/signout/+server.ts`.

And add the following code:

```ts title="src/routes/auth/signout/+server.ts"
import { auth } from '$lib/server';
import type { RequestHandler } from './$types';

export const POST: RequestHandler = async ({ locals }) => {
	const session = await locals.auth.validate();

	if (!session) {
		return new Response(null, {
			status: 400
		});
	}

	// Invalidate session or alternatively, you can delete all sessions: await auth.invalidateAllUserSessions(session.userId);
	await auth.invalidateSession(session.sessionId);

	// Remove the cookie.
	locals.auth.setSession(null);

	return new Response(null, {
		status: 200
	});
};
```

Again Lucia has our back by making it incredibly easy to invalidate sessions. All we need to do now is call this endpoint when the user clicks the sign out button.

```svelte title="src/routes/app/+page.svelte"
<script lang="ts">
	import { goto } from '$app/navigation';
	import { Button } from '$lib/components/common';

	async function handleSignOut() {
		const response = await fetch('/auth/signout', {
			method: 'POST',
			headers: {
				'Content-Type': 'application/json'
			}
		});

		if (response.ok) {
			goto('/auth/signin', {
				replaceState: true,
				invalidateAll: true
			});
		}
	}
</script>

<Button on:click={handleSignOut}>Sign out</Button>
```

## That's a wrap

We've successfully created type-safe authentication with Lucia, PlanetScale, and Upstash Redis. And we've only scratched the surface of what Lucia can do.

Again, you can find the repo for this guide [here](https://github.com/upstash/examples) If you want to learn more about Lucia, I highly recommend checking out the [docs](https://lucia-auth.com/).

Before you move on you should come hang out in the [Upstash Discord](https://discord.gg/hEHsgSHtT7) community — we're having a good ol' time. And also if you want more SvelteKit content, you can find it on my blog [here](https://chrisjayden.com).
