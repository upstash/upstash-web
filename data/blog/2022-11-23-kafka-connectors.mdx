Here at Upstash, we are providing Serverless Kafka with a per usage pricing which is loved and used extensively. 
There was a main ingredient missing from this until now, which is Kafka Connect.

## What is Kafka Connect ?

One of the main usecases of Kafka is to use it as a bridge between different systems 
so that these services are decoupled from each other. 

You can collect your data from different databases to Kafka to be used later from various decoupled 
applications to server your needs. 
Also you may need to store what is in your Kafka topics to a well known database/datalake.

[Kafka Connect](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#connect) is here so that you don't need to implement
a single line of code to Connect external systems to Kafka.

There is still a problem tough. You need to manage it yourself.
As we always do, we don't want our users to manage a server or a process.
And again, we are here to get that burden of your shoulders. 

To help you, we are proudly announcing **managed**, **low latency** and **free** [Upstash Kafka Connect](https://docs.upstash.com/kafka/connectintro). 

With **Upstash Managed  Kafka Connect**,
- You don't need to worry about the health/scale of your Kafka Connect. It is 24/7 **managed** by our team for you.
- Your Kafka Connect is right besides your Kafka Cluster so that you benefit from Kafka Connect with **low latency**.
- And compared to other Managed Kafka Connect Providers, it is **free**. You only pay for per message activity on your 
Kafka topics. There is no additional cost for using Managed Kafka Connect.

We will be starting with following connectors from day one:

- [Mongo Source Connector](https://docs.upstash.com/kafka/mongosource)
- [Mongo Sink Connector](https://docs.upstash.com/kafka/mongosink)
- [Debezium Mongo Source Connector](https://docs.upstash.com/kafka/debeziummongo)
- [Debezium Mysql Source Connector](https://docs.upstash.com/kafka/debeziummysql)

Our aim is to always help manage with whatever you need. So, if the connector that you need is not in this list, please add a request to our [Road Map](https://roadmap.upstash.com/).
