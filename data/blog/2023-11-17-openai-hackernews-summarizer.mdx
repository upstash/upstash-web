Today, we're diving into the creation of a minified version of [HackerDigest](https://hackerdigest.upstash.app). Here's how HackerDigest operates: it begins by fetching the top 10 stories from Hacker News. Next, it leverages OpenAI's ChatGPT to process and analyze these stories.
Finally, it stores the results in Redis. This entire process is made super easy thanks to Qstash. So, buckle up as we set out on this journey.

First things first, let's set up a [Redis](https://console.upstash.com/redis). Head over to Upstash Redis Console to get your keys, which will look something like this:

```sh
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL="https://us1-XXX-38101.upstash.io"
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN="AZTVACQXXXVhOTktYzI0Mi0XXXM4ZmQzMjI3NDY0NTZmNDXXXYjQ0NGY4MGYwNDI="
```

Good, now head over to [Qstash](https://console.upstash.com/qstash), and get your secrets that are needed for NextJS.

```sh
QSTASH_CURRENT_SIGNING_KEY=XXXX
QSTASH_NEXT_SIGNING_KEY=XXXX
```

One more thing left, we also need [OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) key for that just create yourself a key and you are good to go.

Final `env` file will look like this:

## Env Key Setup

```sh
OPENAI_API_KEY=XXXX

UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL="https://us1-XXX-38101.upstash.io"
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN="AZTVACQXXXVhOTktYzI0Mi0XXXM4ZmQzMjI3NDY0NTZmNDXXXYjQ0NGY4MGYwNDI="

QSTASH_CURRENT_SIGNING_KEY=XXXX
QSTASH_NEXT_SIGNING_KEY=XXXX
```

With the grunt work behind us, give yourself a well-deserved pat on the back. Now, let's dive into the juicy part.

## Initial Setup

We need NextJS for that, run this command below:

```sh
npx create-next-app
```

And, do these:

```sh
✔ What is your project named? … hackernews-summarizer
✔ Would you like to use TypeScript? … No / Yes
✔ Would you like to use ESLint? … No / Yes
✔ Would you like to use Tailwind CSS? … No / Yes
✔ Would you like to use `src/` directory? … No / Yes
✔ Would you like to use App Router? (recommended) … No / Yes
✔ Would you like to customize the default import alias (@/*)? … No / Yes
✔ What import alias would you like configured? … @/*

cd hackernews-summarizer && npm i node-html-parser ky @upstash/redis @upstash/ratelimit @upstash/qstash openai
```

Then, see if your project works without an issue, simply run:

```sh
npm run dev
```

Okay, before we move on we have to put our `env` keys into `env.local` file. Create `env.local` in the root of your project - where `package.json` lives. Then, simply copy them.

So far so good. Let's move on.

## Folder Structure

```sh

 ┃ ┣ 📜link-parser.ts
 ┃ ┗ 📜summarizer.ts
```

Looks cool, right? We will start off with libs folder. This is where we initialize our clients like Redis and fetcher - [Ky](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ky) in our case.

## Fun Begins

### 📂libs/📜redis-client

```ts
import { Redis } from "@upstash/redis";

export const redisClient = () => {
  const token = process.env.UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN;
  const url = process.env.UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL;

  if (!url) throw new Error("Redis URL is missing!");
  if (!token) throw new Error("Redis TOKEN is missing!");

  const redis = new Redis({
    url,
    token,
  });

  return redis;
};
```

### 📂libs/📜requester.ts

```ts
import ky from "ky";

const HN_BASE_URL = "https://hacker-news.firebaseio.com/v0/";

export const requester = ky.create({
  cache: "no-cache",
  prefixUrl: HN_BASE_URL,
  headers: {
    pragma: "no-cache",
  },
});
```

Now, let's proceed to `services/hackernews.ts`. In this section, our goal is to:

- Fetch all the top stories from Hacker News.
- Filter these stories based on their scores, ensuring they fall within a 12-hour period.
- Retrieve the details of the selected stories and return them.

### 📂services/📜hackernews.ts

```ts
import { requester } from "@/app/libs/requester";

// Fetch the top story IDs
async function fetchTopStoryIds(): Promise<number[]> {
  const storyIds: number[] = await requester.get(`topstories.json`).json();
  return storyIds;
}
```

Now, we need to filter them.

```ts
type HackerNewsStoryRaw = {
  id: number;
  by: string; // Author of the story
  score: number;
  time: number;
  title: string;
  url: string;
  descendants: number; // Number of comments
  type: "story"; // Ensures the type is strictly 'story'
};

export type HackerNewsStory = {
  author: string;
  score: number;
  title: string;
  url: string;
  numOfComments: number;
  commentUrl: string;
  postedDate: string;
};

// Fetch story details by ID
// Fetch top stories from the last 12 hours
export async function fetchTopStoriesFromLast12Hours(
  limit: number = 10,
): Promise<HackerNewsStory[]> {
  const twelveHoursAgoTimestamp = Date.now() - 12 * 60 * 60 * 1000;
  const topStoryIds = await fetchTopStoryIds();

  const storyDetailsPromises = topStoryIds.map(fetchStoryDetails);
  const allStories = await Promise.all(storyDetailsPromises);

  const topStoriesFromLast12Hours = allStories
    .filter((story) => story && story.time * 1000 >= twelveHoursAgoTimestamp)
    .sort((a, b) => b!.score - a!.score)
    .slice(0, limit) as HackerNewsStoryRaw[];

  return topStoriesFromLast12Hours.map((story) => ({
    commentUrl: `https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=${story.id}`,
    postedDate: timeSince(story.time * 1000),
    numOfComments: story.descendants,
    author: story.by,
    url: story.url,
    title: story.title,
    score: story.score,
  }));
}
```

We'll also need some types to ensure type-safety. Here's an overview of what this function does:

- It begins by fetching topStoryIds.
- For each story, it calls fetchStoryDetails (which we'll implement shortly).
- The stories are then filtered to ensure they fall within the specified time period, sorted by their scores.
- Since we only need 10 stories (our limit), the list is sliced accordingly.
- Before returning the data, a final mapping step is performed to enhance the API's user-friendliness, appending additional data.
- Before moving on let's add `fetchStoryDetails`

```ts
// Fetch story details by ID
async function fetchStoryDetails(
  id: number,
): Promise<HackerNewsStoryRaw | null> {
  const story: HackerNewsStoryRaw | null = await requester
    .get(`item/${id}.json`)
    .json();
  // Check if the story has a URL and is of type 'story'
  if (story && story.url && story.type === "story") {
    return story;
  }
  return null;
}
```

For the `fetchStoryDetails` function, it's a straightforward call to the endpoint with the story ID. However, there's a caveat: not all items retrieved are stories; sometimes, there are different data types. To address this, we need to ensure that the fetched items are indeed stories before proceeding.

Now that we've covered this part, let's proceed to parsing links within Hacker News stories.
Since many stories redirect users to external links, it's critical to tell our summarizer to navigate to these links, extract their content, and provide it back.
This way, we can effectively feed ChatGPT with the relevant information.

### 📂services/📜link-parser.ts

Our approach for parsing links within Hacker News stories involves navigating to the provided URL, using `node-html-parser` for extraction.
We'll check if the page contains `p` tags; if present, we'll extract the entire content. In case `p` tags are missing, we'll fallback to extracting content within `div` tags.
The extracted content will then be pushed into `chunkString` since some stories are extensive, and breaking them into smaller chunks is necessary to comply with ChatGPT's token limit (which restricts input to less than 4K tokens at once).
We'll also have some utility functions to make things easier and cleaner.

```ts
import parse, { HTMLElement } from "node-html-parser";

async function fetchInnerContent(
  url?: string,
): Promise<string | string[] | null> {
  if (!url) throw new Error("URL is missing!");
  if (!isValidUrl(url)) throw new Error("URL is not valid");

  try {
    const response = await fetch(url); // Can be replaced with Ky client
    const html = await response.text();
    const root = parse(html);

    let content = extractText(root.querySelectorAll("p"));

    if (!content) {
      // If no content was found in <p> tags, fallback to <div> tags
      content = extractText(root.querySelectorAll("div"));
    }

    // Assuming chunkString splits the string into manageable pieces
    return chunkString(content); // Ensure chunkString handles an empty string properly
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error fetching content:", error);
    return null;
  }
}

function isValidUrl(urlString: string): boolean {
  try {
    new URL(urlString);
    return true;
  } catch (err) {
    return false;
  }
}

function chunkString(inputString: string, chunkSize = 4000) {
  if (inputString.length <= chunkSize) return inputString;
  else {
    const chunks = [];
    for (let i = 0; i < inputString.length; i += chunkSize) {
      chunks.push(inputString.slice(i, i + chunkSize));
    }
    return chunks;
  }
}

// A function to clean and prepare text content
function cleanText(text: string) {
  return text.replace(/\s+/g, " ").trim();
}

// A function to extract text from a collection of nodes
function extractText(nodes: HTMLElement[]) {
  return nodes.map((node) => cleanText(node.innerText)).join(" ");
}
```

It's time to feed our parse with some Hacker News data!

```ts
type Content = (string | string[]) | null;
export type HackerNewsStoryWithRawContent = HackerNewsStory & {
  rawContent: Content;
};
export type HackerNewsStoryWithParsedContent = HackerNewsStory & {
  parsedContent: Content;
};

export async function getContentsOfArticles(
  articleLimit: number,
): Promise<HackerNewsStoryWithRawContent[] | undefined> {
  const articleLinksAndTitles =
    await fetchTopStoriesFromLast12Hours(articleLimit);
  return await Promise.all(
    articleLinksAndTitles.map(async (article) => ({
      ...article,
      rawContent: await fetchInnerContent(article.url),
    })),
  );
}
```

To prepare for the next steps, we begin by extending our `HackerNewsStory` type with additional fields: `rawContent` and `parsedContent` for future use.
Following this, we call `fetchTopStoriesFromLast12Hours` to retrieve the top 10 stories. These stories are then mapped over, and the URLs are parsed into `rawContent`.
This parsed content will be utilized in the subsequent stage, where we feed it to ChatGPT.

Time to move to most critical part.

### 📂services/📜summarizer.ts

This is where the magic happens. Fortunately, most of the code is quite straightforward, mainly consisting of OpenAI configurations. Let's dive into it from the beginning.

```ts
import {
  getContentsOfArticles,
  HackerNewsStoryWithParsedContent,
  HackerNewsStoryWithRawContent,
} from "@/services/link-parser";
import { OpenAI } from "openai";

const openai = new OpenAI({
  apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
  organization: process.env.OPENAI_ORGANIZATION_API,
});

async function summarizeText(
  title: string,
  content: string,
): Promise<string | undefined> {
  const prompt = `
  Title: "${title}"
  Summarize the following news article in 2-3 clear and concise sentences without repetition: "${content}"`;

  try {
    const chatCompletion = await openai.completions.create({
      model: "gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct",
      prompt,
      temperature: 0.2,
      frequency_penalty: 0,
      presence_penalty: 0,
      max_tokens: 150,
      stream: false,
      n: 1,
    });
    return chatCompletion.choices[0]?.text;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("summarizeText failed", (error as Error).message);
  }
}

async function summarizeChunk(chunk?: string) {
  if (!chunk) return null;

  const prompt = `
      Please provide a concise summary of the following text and please ensure that the summary avoids any unnecessary information or repetition: "${chunk}"
      `;
  const chatCompletion = await openai.completions.create({
    model: "gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct",
    prompt,
    temperature: 0.2,
    frequency_penalty: 0,
    presence_penalty: 0,
    max_tokens: 300,
    stream: false,
    n: 1,
  });
  return chatCompletion.choices[0]?.text;
}
```

We need two functions: one for summarizing short texts without chunking and another for summarizing chunks without losing much context. Feel free to make adjustments as needed.

Now, we need a function to determine whether to call the summarization function for an array or a string, depending on the type of rawContent.

```ts
async function summarizeArticles(
  article: HackerNewsStoryWithRawContent,
): Promise<string | undefined> {
  if (!Array.isArray(article.rawContent)) {
    try {
      if (!article.rawContent)
        throw new Error("Content is missing from summarizeArticles!");
      const summarizedText = await summarizeText(
        article.title,
        article.rawContent,
      );
      if (!summarizedText) throw new Error("summarizedText is missing!");
      return summarizedText;
    } catch (error) {
      console.error(
        `Something went wrong when summarizing single article ${
          (error as Error).message
        }`,
      );
    }
  } else {
    const summarizedChunks = await Promise.all(
      article.rawContent.map((chunk) => summarizeChunk(chunk)),
    );

    try {
      const summarizedText = await summarizeText(
        article.title,
        summarizedChunks.filter(Boolean).join(" "),
      );
      if (!summarizedText) throw new Error("chunkedSummarizedText is missing!");
      return summarizedText;
    } catch (error) {
      console.error(
        `Something went wrong when summarizing chunked articles ${
          (error as Error).message
        }`,
      );
    }
  }
}
```

It's a straightforward process: we check if `rawContent` is an array. If it is, we call `summarizedChunks` and then feed those results into `summarizedText`. If not, we directly call `summarizedText`.

Next, we'll call the function `getContentsOfArticles` to retrieve parsed raw contents.
These contents will then be fed into the summarizer function. Finally, we'll omit the rawContent from the object since it's no longer needed.

```ts
export async function getSummarizedArticles(
  articleLimit: number,
): Promise<HackerNewsStoryWithParsedContent[] | undefined> {
  const res = await getContentsOfArticles(articleLimit);
  if (res && res.length > 0) {
    const summarizedArticlesPromises = res.map(async (article) => {
      if (article.rawContent) {
        const { rawContent, ...articleWithoutRawContent } = article;
        const parsedContent = await summarizeArticles(article);
        return { parsedContent, ...articleWithoutRawContent };
      }
      return null;
    });

    const summarizedArticles = await Promise.all(summarizedArticlesPromises);

    return summarizedArticles.filter(
      Boolean,
    ) as HackerNewsStoryWithParsedContent[];
  }
}
```

Now, all we have to do is create an endpoint to call this function. But before that, we need to figure out a way to store those processed stories, and Upstash Redis comes to the rescue.
We can easily store them in Redis once we are done processing them, allowing us to use them anytime in our API, pages, or even in another app, if needed.

### 📂commands/📜constants.ts

```ts
export const redisKey = "hackerdigest";
```

We need to store our key somewhere, and `constant.ts` is a good place for that. Maybe in the future we might end up with more keys.

We also need a way to get them back from Redis when we need so where comes the `get.ts`

### 📂commands/📜get.ts

```ts
import { redisClient } from "../app/libs/redis-client";
import { HackerNewsStoryWithParsedContent } from "../services/link-parser";
import { redisKey } from "./constants";

export type ArticlesType = {
  stories: (HackerNewsStoryWithParsedContent | null)[];
  lastFetched: string;
};

export const getArticles = async () => {
  const redis = redisClient();
  return await redis.get<ArticlesType>(redisKey);
};
```

Another one for storing.

### 📂commands/📜set.ts

```ts
import { redisClient } from "../app/libs/redis-client";
import { HackerNewsStoryWithParsedContent } from "../services/link-parser";
import { redisKey } from "./constants";
import { ArticlesType } from "./get";

export const setArticles = async (
  stories: HackerNewsStoryWithParsedContent[],
) => {
  const redis = redisClient();
  await redis.set<ArticlesType>(redisKey, {
    stories,
    lastFetched: new Date().toJSON(),
  });
};
```

These utilities are quite straightforward to use. Once you begin using `redis.get` and `redis.get`, you find yourself passing the key - in our case, '**hackerdigest**' - and return types throughout the app, which can quickly become ugly and difficult to maintain.
So, we opted for this approach to streamline the process.

Now, it's time to make our APIs we will start with `summarize` end point.

### 📂api/📂summarize/📜route.ts

```ts
import { NextResponse } from "next/server";

import { setArticles } from "@/commands/set";
import { getSummarizedArticles } from "@/services/summarizer";
import { verifySignatureAppRouter } from "@upstash/qstash/dist/nextjs";

export const maxDuration = 300;

async function handler() {
  try {
    const articles = await getSummarizedArticles(10);
    if (articles) {
      await setArticles(articles);
      return NextResponse.json({ articles });
    } else {
      console.error("Stories are missing!");
      return NextResponse.json({}, { status: 400 });
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(
      `Something went wrong when saving to cache or retriving stories ${
        (error as Error).message
      }`,
    );
    return NextResponse.json({}, { status: 400 });
  }
}
export const POST = verifySignatureAppRouter(handler);
```

Firstly, we need to set `maxDuration` to a value higher than the default, which is 15, because OpenAI processes may take some time due to extensive computations.
The rest is relatively simple – we just invoke `getSummarizedArticles` with the desired limit.
If the operation is successful, we save the results to the cache and return.
To enable periodic API calls with Qstash, we wrap the handler with `verifySignatureAppRouter` to ensure that only Qstash can access this endpoint. Additionally, it should be a POST request.

Now, we need a way to get those processed stories.

### 📂api/📂stories/📜route.ts

```ts
import { NextRequest, NextResponse } from "next/server";

import { getArticles } from "@/commands/get";
import { Ratelimit } from "@upstash/ratelimit";
import { Redis } from "@upstash/redis";

export async function GET(req: NextRequest) {
  const ratelimit = new Ratelimit({
    redis: Redis.fromEnv(),
    limiter: Ratelimit.slidingWindow(10, "10s"),
    prefix: "hackerdigest-stories",
  });

  const ip = (req.headers.get("x-forwarded-for") ?? "127.0.0.1").split(",")[0];
  const { success } = await ratelimit.limit(ip);
  if (!success) {
    return NextResponse.json({ message: "You shall not pass!" });
  }
  const { stories } = await getArticles();

  return NextResponse.json({ stories });
}
```

This is also quite straightforward; we simply invoke `getArticles`. However, to prevent abuse of our app, we need to implement rate limiting using `@upstash/ratelimit` and use the user's IP address as an identifier.

Let's add a simple HTML and Tailwind to see how it looks.

### 📜page.tsx

```tsx
import { getArticles } from "@/commands/get";

export default async function Home() {
  const { stories } = await getArticles();

  return (
