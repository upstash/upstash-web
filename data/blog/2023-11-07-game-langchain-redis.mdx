Redis is often used to speed up IO-based operations by providing a cache layer that stores data in-memory. Compared to traditional, relational databases, [Upstash Redis](https://upstash.com/docs/redis/overall/getstarted) boasts significantly faster read and write performance coupled with seamless scalability. While it doesn't allow you to form complex queries involving arbitrary properties, Redis is still versatile enough to emulate many features of relational databases through secondary indices.

Upstash provides a TypeScript SDK specifically for this purposeâ€”[`@upstash/query`](https://github.com/upstash/query). The SDK allows you to automatically create secondary indices on Redis data, and then query them using a simple, type-safe API. In this tutorial, we'll be using `@upstash/query` to create a "Would You Rather" game that generates questions and options using [LangChain](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchainjs). You'll be able to vote for an option on each question, and have everything persist on Upstash Redis.

We'll build the application using [Hono.js](https://hono.dev/), a lightweight Bun-compatible web framework for the edge. We'll also use [HTMX](https://htmx.org/) to send AJAX requests to our API, [UnoCSS](https://unocss.dev/) to build our interface, and [@kitajs/html](https://github.com/kitajs/html) to directly serve HTML from our API endpoints with JSX. Thanks to Upstash, our application will be fully compatible with edge and serverless environments. We'll deploy our application using [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/).

This tutorial was inspired by a [great video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ61RL1GpEE) on using Redis as a database by Dreams of Code. You can find the full source code for this demo [here](https://github.com/ap-1/langchain-upstash-query).

## Prerequisites

- [An Upstash Redis database](https://upstash.com/docs/redis/overall/getstarted)
- [An OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)

## Getting started

### Creating the project

First, we need to create a new Hono.js app. We'll be using [Bun](https://bun.sh/) here, but you can use any package manager you want:

```bash
bun create hono@latest would-you-rather
```

When prompted, be sure to select `cloudflare-workers`. Even though we are using Bun to scaffold our project, the `bun` option is not what we are looking for. This will create a new project in the `would-you-rather` directory. Navigate to it, and install the remaining dependencies:

```bash
bun install @upstash/redis @upstash/query langchain openai
```

### Configuring the project

In order for our environment variables to be accessible in our Cloudflare Worker, we need to set them in our `wrangler.toml`. Append the following to the file:

```toml
[vars]
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL="https://********.upstash.io"
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN="********"
OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-********"
```

To make our environment variables type-safe, we can modify our `src/index.ts` as follows:

```ts
export type Bindings = {
	UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL: string;
	UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN: string;
	OPENAI_API_KEY: string;
};

const app = new Hono<{ Bindings: Bindings }>();
```

This will add the correct properties to our `context.env`. Before we first deploy our worker, we want to add logging for debugging purposes. This can be accomplished through a middleware that Hono already provides for us:

```ts
import { logger } from "hono/logger";

// snip

const app = new Hono<{ Bindings: Bindings }>();

app.use("*", logger());
```

### Setting up JSX

Our first step is to rename the `src/index.ts` file to `src/index.tsx`, and to make the appropriate changes to the
scripts in `package.json`:

```json
"scripts": {
	"dev": "wrangler dev src/index.tsx",
	"deploy": "wrangler deploy --minify src/index.tsx"
}
```

Then, we have to install a few packages to set up JSX.

```bash
bun install @kitajs/html @kitajs/ts-html-plugin
```

It is relatively straightforward to set up `@kitajs/html`. We just have to tell tsc to transpile JSX into calls to the `@kitajs/html` namespace. In addition, `@kitajs/ts-html-plugin` is an LSP plugin for the TypeScript language server. When we use JSX in our code, it will alert us about potential XSS vulnerabilities by emitting TypeScript errors. Adjust `tsconfig.json` as follows:

```json
{
	"compilerOptions": {
		"jsx": "react",
		"jsxFactory": "Html.createElement",
		"jsxFragmentFactory": "Html.Fragment",
		"plugins": [{ "name": "@kitajs/ts-html-plugin" }]
	}
}
```

Make sure to remove the existing `jsxImportSource` property as it is no longer needed. Now, we can create a new file to store our `Layout` component, which serves as template HTML contianing the head and `<!DOCTYPE html>`. Create a `src/layout.tsx` and add the following:

```tsx
import Html from "@kitajs/html";

export const Layout = ({ children }: Html.PropsWithChildren) => {
	return (
		<>
			{"<!DOCTYPE html>"}
			<html lang="en">
				<head>
					<meta charset="UTF-8" />
					<meta
						name="viewport"
						content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"
					/>

					<script src="https://unpkg.com/htmx.org@1.9.6"></script>

					<title>Would You Rather</title>
				</head>
				<body>{children}</body>
			</html>
		</>
	);
};
```

Here, we made a new JSX component that provides all the boilerplate for an HTML page. We're also importing the script for HTMX here. We can use this component in our routes to directly render elements in `<body>`. Let's do this in our `src/index.tsx` so we can view the page:

```tsx
import Html from "@kitajs/html";

import { Hono } from "hono";
import { logger } from "hono/logger";

import { Layout } from "./layout";
```

First, we import the Html namespace so our JSX can be transpiled properly. Then, we import our `Layout` component from earlier. Because `@kitajs/html` components get rendered to `string`s, serving them as HTML is as simple as follows:

```tsx
app.get("/", (c) => c.html((<Layout>Hello world</Layout>) as string));
```

We only have to cast it as a `string` because `JSX.Element` would be a `Promise<string>` if the component was async. Finally, add the following line at the top of the file to add typing for HTMX attributes:

```tsx
/// <reference types="@kitajs/html/htmx.d.ts" />
```

### Setting up UnoCSS

In our app, we'll use [UnoCSS](https://unocss.dev/) for styling. We will use the UnoCSS CLI to scan our `*.tsx` files and generate a stylesheet. First, we need to install the CLI:

```bash
bun install -d unocss
```

Start by creating a `uno.config.ts` file in the project root. This is how we tell the UnoCSS extension to enable itself. In addition, we'll specify where to find the preflight styles here.

```ts
import { defineConfig, presetUno } from "unocss";
import { readFile } from "node:fs/promises";

const path = "node_modules/@unocss/reset/tailwind.css";

export default defineConfig({
	presets: [presetUno()],
	preflights: [
		{
			layer: "base",
			getCSS: () => readFile(path, "utf-8"),
		},
	],
	content: {
		pipeline: {
			include: ["**.tsx"],
		},
	},
});
```

In order for the `node:fs/promise` import to not raise an error, we have to add the `node` types in `tsconfig.json`:

```json
"types": ["@cloudflare/workers-types", "node"],
```

Then, we can create a new script in our `package.json`:

```json
"uno": "unocss **.tsx --preflights --minify --out-file static/uno.css",
```

We are instructing UnoCSS to scan all `*.tsx` files in our project folder, and then to generate preflight styles as well as minified styles from our classes in `static/uno.css`. UnoCSS also has a `--watch` flag for use in development, but we don't have to include it because `wrangler` already does this for us.

Next, we have to tell `wrangler` to use this script when building our project. We can do this with a [custom build](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/custom-builds/), which lets us run our own build step before Cloudflare's one. Add this section to your `wrangler.toml`:

```toml
main = "workers-site/index.js"

[build]
command = "bun run uno"

[site]
bucket = "./static"
```

We also have to set up `wrangler` to serve static files. Under `[site]`, we can specify which directory the static files are placed in. Along with this, we must also specify the main entrypoint for our site. Cloudflare can infer this as of now, but that behavior can change at any point because it relies on the deprecated `site.entry-point` field. `Now is a good time to add the file to our`.gitignore`:

```ignore
uno.css
wrangler.toml
```

Since the `uno.css` file will be created in the `static` folder, we need some way to serve the contents of this folder to our app. We can do this with the `serveStatic()` handler provided by Hono.js:

```ts
import { Hono } from "hono";
import { logger } from "hono/logger";
import { serveStatic } from "hono/cloudflare-workers";

// snip

app.use("/*", serveStatic({ root: "./" }));
```

Finally, we can link the generated stylesheet in our HTML. Adjust `src/layout.tsx` as follows:

```html
<link href="/uno.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" />
<script src="https://unpkg.com/htmx.org@1.9.6"></script>
```

### Deployment

Since we're using Cloudflare Workers, we can use `wrangler` to deploy our project. During development, you can run the following command with your preferred package manager:

```bash
bun run dev
```

`wrangler` will read our environment variables and spin up our Hono.js server, providing us with a local URL on port 8787 to test our project. At this point, we should only see a blank page with "Hello world" on it. If we wanted to test using edge preview sessions instead, we could replace our `"dev"` script with the following:

```json
"dev": "wrangler dev src/index.tsx --remote",
```

When you want to deploy, you can use the following command:

```bash
bun run deploy
```

On the first run, this will walk you through signing into Cloudflare and setting up your project. Doing so will also allow you to view your Cloudflare Worker's configuration and logs.

## Creating API endpoints

For organizational purposes, let's create a new Hono.js route group for our API endpoints. It will contain all endpoints that are prefixed with `/api`. Create a new file called `src/api/index.ts`:

```ts
import { Hono } from "hono";
import { type Bindings } from "..";

import { generate } from "./generate";
import { retrieve } from "./retrieve";
import { vote } from "./vote";

type Option = {
	text: string;
	votes: number;
};

export type Question = {
	id: number;
	text: string;
	options: Option[];
};

export const api = new Hono<{ Bindings: Bindings }>();

api.post("/generate", generate);
api.get("/retrieve", retrieve);
api.post("/vote", vote);
```

You can see we have defined two types: `Option`, which will represent a specific choice that the user can select in response to a "Would You Rather" question; and `Question`, which associates generated questions and options. We also created a placeholders for several routes here. We'll go through them one-by-one, but for now, you can create `*.tsx` files for each of them in the `src/api` folder (e.g. `src/api/generate.tsx`):

```tsx
import Html from "@kitajs/html";

import { Query } from "@upstash/query";
import { Redis } from "@upstash/redis/cloudflare";

import { type Handler } from "hono";
import { type Question } from ".";

export const handler: Handler = async (c) => {
	return c.text("Hello world");
};
```

Be sure to rename the function from `handler` to the name of the file. We'll use HTMX to call these routes from the frontend to generate new questions using LangChain, retrieve previously generated questions, and to vote on specific options, respectively. Let's add this route group to the main app in `src/index.tsx`:

```tsx
import { api } from "./api";

// snip

const app = new Hono<{ Bindings: Bindings }>();
app.route("/api", api);
```

### Generating new questions

Now, we can add functionality in the `/api/generate` endpoint to generate a new question. We can start by creating an `@upstash/query` client inside `src/api/generate.tsx`:

```ts
export const generate: Handler = async (c) => {
	const redis = new Redis({
		url: c.env.UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL,
		token: c.env.UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN,
		automaticDeserialization: false,
	});

	const query = new Query({ redis });

	return c.text("Hello world");
};
```

Here, we create a new Redis client using `@upstash/redis`, and then pass it into the Query client constructor. We have to pass all of our API keys manually, as `Redis.fromEnv()` can't read them automatically on Cloudflare Workers. Also, it's important to turn off `automaticDeserialization` as `@upstash/query` already does this for us. Using the Query client, let's create a collection for our questions:

```ts
const query = new Query({ redis });
const questions = query.createCollection<Question>("questions");
```

Now, we can create a searchable index under the collection using the `id` property we just defined:

```ts
const questions = query.createCollection<Question>("questions");
const questionsById = questions.createIndex({
	name: "questions_by_id",
	terms: ["id"],
});
```

Notice that since we supplied our `Question` type to `createCollection` before, the values of `terms` are fully type-safe! We can add as many terms as we see fitâ€”even nested ones like `options.length`. In this case, we'll only be searching by `id`. Don't worry about this too much just yet, as we'll be using it when we retrieve existing questions.

In order to generate a question alongside its answer choices, let's create [structured output with OpenAI functions](https://js.langchain.com/docs/modules/chains/popular/structured_output). We'll create a schema and convert it into an OpenAI function, which the LLM is forced to call in order to return the response in the correct format.

This is a replacement for `StructuredOutputParser` that doesn't require output instructions to be included in the prompt. It produces more reliable results, especially with higher `temperature` valuesâ€”which is the case in this demo. First, install the following packages to create our schema:

```bash
bun install zod zod-to-json-schema
```

Then, still inside `src/api/generate.tsx`, we can import these packages and create the schema:

```ts
import { z } from "zod";
import { zodToJsonSchema } from "zod-to-json-schema";

// snip

const questionSchema = z.object({
	text: z
		.string()
		.describe(
			"The actual text of the would-you-rather question that gets presented to the user."
		),
	options: z
		.array(
			z
				.string()
				.describe(
					"The actual text of an option that get presented to the user."
				)
		)
		.describe("The options that the user can choose from."),
});
```

We're now ready to generate the question with LangChain. Again, we'll have to supply our API key manually to the `ChatOpenAI` model.

```ts
import { ChatOpenAI } from "langchain/chat_models/openai";
import { JsonOutputFunctionsParser } from "langchain/output_parsers";

export const generate: Handler = async (c) => {
	// snip

	const llm = new ChatOpenAI({
		openAIApiKey: c.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
		temperature: 1,
	});

	const model = llm.bind({
		functions: [
			{
				name: "output_formatter",
				description: "Should always be used to properly format output",
				parameters: zodToJsonSchema(questionSchema),
			},
		],
		function_call: { name: "output_formatter" },
	});

	// snip
};
```

Binding `function_call` forces the model to always call the specified function. Since we're specifically using the function to retrieve output, we have to include it. The next step is to parse the output.

```ts
const outputParser = new JsonOutputFunctionsParser();
const chain = model.pipe(outputParser);

const response = (await chain.invoke(
	"Generate a fun, never-before-heard-of question for a would-you-rather game."
)) as z.infer<typeof questionSchema>;
```

For simplicity's sake, in this demo, we are carefully wording the prompt to avoid duplicate questions as best we can. In an actual application, you can use something like `BufferMemory` along with [`UpstashRedisChatMessageHistory`](https://js.langchain.com/docs/modules/memory/integrations/upstash_redis) in a `ConversationChain` to properly ensure there are no repeated questions.

`response` should match the schema we passed in earlier, so we type it as such. Before we can save the question LangChain generated, we need a way to create `id`s for our questions. Let's use a new Redis key to store the number of questions we have generated, so we can increment the key each time we make a new question.

```ts
const id = await redis.incr("num_questions");
```

This is as simple as calling one function using `@upstash/redis`. The `incr()` method automatically creates the key and initializes it to `0` if it doesn't exist, and then increments the key and returns the new value. Now, we can use this `id` when creating and storing our question:

```ts
const question: Question = {
	id,
	text: response.text,
	options: response.options.map((option) => ({
		text: option,
		votes: 0,
	})),
};

await questions.set(id, question);
```

We did a small amount of manipulation on the response from LangChain in order to make it fit our `Question` type from earlier. We can now return the generated question to the frontend:

```tsx
const html = (
	<div id="question">
		<p>Question: {question.text}</p>
		{question.options.map((option) => (
			<div>
				<p>Option: {option.text}</p>
				<p>Votes: {option.votes}</p>
			</div>
		))}
	</div>
);

return c.html(html as string);
```

Finally, let's add the correct HTMX attributes to our `src/index.tsx` so we can call the `/api/generate` endpoint from the frontend:

```tsx
app.get("/", (c) => {
	const html = (
		<Layout>
			<button
				hx-post="/api/generate"
				hx-disabled-elt="this"
				hx-target="#question"
				hx-swap="outerHTML"
				hx-trigger="click"
			>
				Generate new question
			</button>

			<div id="question"></div>
		</Layout>
	);

	return c.html(html as string);
});
```

We tell the button to call `/api/generate` when `click` is triggered, and then to replace the `#question` div with the returned response. HTMX will also disable the button for us for the duration of the request. Notice that the `#question` div matches what we're returning from our `/api/generate` endpoint.

At this stage, you should be able to test what we wrote:

```bash
bun run dev
```

After pressing `Generate new question`, you should see something like this:

![Generated question and options passed to frontend](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ap-1/langchain-upstash-query/main/static/generated.png)

In the Upstash Redis database, you should see two new keys being populated:

![num_questions key in Upstash Redis database](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ap-1/langchain-upstash-query/main/static/num_questions.png)
![@upstash/query key in Upstash Redis database](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ap-1/langchain-upstash-query/main/static/upstash_query.png)

### Retrieving existing questions

Like before, let's create a new Redis client, attach it to our Query client, and create the collection for our questions. Modify `src/api/retrieve.tsx` as follows:

```ts
export const retrieve: Handler = async (c) => {
	const redis = new Redis({
		url: c.env.UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL,
		token: c.env.UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN,
		automaticDeserialization: false,
	});

	const query = new Query({ redis });
	const questions = query.createCollection<Question>("questions");
	const questionsById = questions.createIndex({
		name: "questions_by_id",
		terms: ["id"],
	});

	return c.text("Hello world");
};
```

We also create the index again so we can search the questions by `id`. Let's find the `id` using the `num_questions` key we created earlier:

```ts
const numQuestions = (await redis.get("num_questions")) as string;
const id = Math.floor(Math.random() * parseInt(numQuestions)) + 1;

const documents = await questionsById.match({ id });
const question = documents[0].data;
```

Since we are incrementing `num_questions` every time we create a new question, `numQuestions` represents the highest `id` in our Redis database. Since we want to retrieve a random question, all we have to do is find an `id` that lies between `1` and `numQuestions`, inclusive.

Finally, we can query by this `id` to retrieve all matching documents. Again, our `match()` call is completely type-safe thanks to the `Question` type we passed in earlier. In our case, `documents` will only contain one document (the question), so we just pick the first item in the list. We can now return the question to the frontend:

```tsx
const html = (
	<div id="question">
		<p>Question: {question.text}</p>
		{question.options.map((option) => (
			<div>
				<p>Option: {option.text}</p>
				<p>Votes: {option.votes}</p>
			</div>
		))}
	</div>
);

return c.html(html as string);
```

The final step is to create a new button in our `src/index.tsx` so we're also able to retrieve existing questions:

```html
<button
	hx-post="/api/generate"
	hx-disabled-elt="this"
	hx-target="#question"
	hx-swap="outerHTML"
	hx-trigger="click"
>
	Generate new question
</button>

<button
	hx-get="/api/retrieve"
	hx-disabled-elt="this"
	hx-target="#question"
	hx-swap="outerHTML"
	hx-trigger="click"
>
	Retrieve existing question
</button>
```

Press `Generate new question` a few times to increase the number of random questions the code can choose from. Then try `Retrieve existing question`. The page should now be populated with a question that generated earlier:

![Existing question retrieved and passed to frontend](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ap-1/langchain-upstash-query/main/static/existing.png)

You should also see the `num_questions` key in your Upstash Redis database being incremented, along with new `STRING` (ST) and `SET` (SE) keys being created by `@upstash/query`:

![New @upstash/query keys in Upstash Redis database](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ap-1/langchain-upstash-query/main/static/new_keys.png)

### Voting on questions

Let's add the ability to vote on questions. We'll create a new endpoint at `/api/vote` that accepts a `POST` request. From the frontend, we'll be passing the `id` of the question we want to vote on, as well as the index of the option we want to vote for. Modify `src/api/vote.tsx` as follows to retrieve the `id` and `option` index from the querystring:

```tsx
export const vote: Handler = async (c) => {
	const { questionId, optionIdx } = await c.req.param();

	const id = parseInt(questionId);
	const option = parseInt(optionIdx);

	return c.text("Hello world");
};
```

We'll be using the same Redis and Query clients as before, so we can just copy and paste the code from earlier:

```tsx
export const vote: Handler = async (c) => {
	// snip

	const redis = new Redis({
		url: c.env.UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL,
		token: c.env.UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN,
		automaticDeserialization: false,
	});

	const query = new Query({ redis });
	const questions = query.createCollection<Question>("questions");
	const questionsById = questions.createIndex({
		name: "questions_by_id",
		terms: ["id"],
	});

	// snip
};
```

Again, we can use `match()` to retrieve the question we want to vote on. Then, we can increment the `votes` property of the option we want to vote for, `update()` the question, and return it to the frontend:

```tsx
const documents = await questionsById.match({ id });
const question = documents[0].data;

question.options[option].votes += 1;

await questions.update(questionId, question);

const html = (
	<div id="question">
		<p>Question: {question.text}</p>
		{question.options.map((option) => (
			<div>
				<p>Option: {option.text}</p>
				<p>Votes: {option.votes}</p>
			</div>
		))}
	</div>
);

return c.html(html as string);
```

The code for `/api/vote` is mostly the same as `/api/retrieve`. However, we have no way of actually calling the `/api/vote` endpoint yet.

## Building the frontend

First, let's modify our `src/layout.tsx` slightly to facilitate adding styles to other components:

```tsx
<body class="overflow-hidden h-screen">{children}</body>
```

Now, we can add a proper header to our app in `src/index.tsx`:

```tsx
<Layout>
	<header class="flex flex-row justify-between px-3 h-[3.75rem] bg-zinc-950">
		<button
			class="shrink-0 rounded-md bg-sky-400 text-sky-700 p-2 my-auto"

			hx-disabled-elt="this"
			hx-target="#question"

			hx-trigger="click"

		</button>

		<h1 class="text-md sm:text-xl py-4 text-center text-white font-bold uppercase my-auto">

		</button>
	</header>

	<div

	>
		<p class="text-4xl text-center font-bold">
			Press one of the two buttons above to play
		</p>
	</div>
</Layout>
```

Now, we can create a new component for our question that we'll share across each API endpoint. Create a new file called `src/components/question.tsx`:

```tsx
import Html from "@kitajs/html";
import { type Question } from "../api";

interface QuestionProps {
	question: Question;
	showResults?: boolean;
}

export const QuestionContainer = ({ question, showResults }: QuestionProps) => {
	const votes = question.options.reduce((s, option) => s + option.votes, 0);

	return (
		<div
			id="question"
			class="h-[calc(100vh-3.75rem)] bg-zinc-900 text-white"
		>
			<div class="flex flex-col h-[calc(100%-1rem)]">
				<div class="shrink-0 flex justify-center py-4">
					<h1 class="w-3/4 text-center text-xl">
						{question.text.replace("Would you rather", "").trim()}
					</h1>
				</div>

				<div class="flex flex-col h-full sm:flex-row gap-2 px-4">
					{question.options.map((option, idx) => (
						<button
							hx-post={`/api/vote?questionId=${question.id}&optionIdx=${idx}`}
							hx-disabled-elt="this"
							hx-target="#question"
							hx-swap="outerHTML"
							hx-trigger="click"
							disabled={showResults}
							class="basis-1/2 flex flex-col justify-center items-center p-16 bg-zinc-800 w-full h-full rounded-md even:bg-blue-600 odd:bg-red-600"
						>
							{showResults && (
								<p class="text-7xl font-extrabold">
									{Math.trunc((100 * option.votes) / votes)}%
								</p>
							)}
							<p class="break-words text-4xl text-center uppercase font-bold">
								{option.text}
							</p>
						</button>
					))}
				</div>
			</div>
		</div>
	);
};
```

We just copied and pasted the question HTML we were using in every API route, with some stylistic changes. There are a few new additions, however. We're removing `"Would you rather"` from each `question.text` because we already included that phrase in our title.

We also added HTMX attributes to the buttons so we can call the `/api/vote` endpoint by pressing an option. Using JSX, we can dynamically construct the query string using the values available to us on the `question` object. Let's update all of our API routes to use this component:

```tsx
import { QuestionContainer } from "../components/question";

// snip

return c.html((<QuestionContainer question={question} />) as string);
```

You can now remove the `const html` lines from before. We also added a `showResults` prop to the component, which will determine whether or not to show the percentage of votes for each option. This will also disable voting afterward. When calculating the percentage, the toal number of votes is found by calling `reduce()` on the options. While two of our routes can ignore this prop, the `/api/vote` route must set it to `true`:

```tsx
<QuestionContainer question={question} showResults />
```

## Conclusion

With the new `QuestionContainer` component and style updates to the `/` route, our app now looks like this:

Selecting an option successfuly calls the `/api/vote` endpoint and updates the option's vote count, which is reflected on our frontend as well as the Upstash Redis console:
