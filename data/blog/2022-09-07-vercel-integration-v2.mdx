Over 18 months ago we have created the Vercel - Upstash integration, allowing
developers to easily create Redis databases and add their connection secrets as
environment variables in Vercel. A lot has changed since then and we have
released 2 new products:

- [Managed Serverless Kafka](https://upstash.com/kafka)
- [QStash](https://upstash.com/qstash)

However it was not possible to use these in the Vercel integration. Until now...

## Vercel + Upstash v2

In the past weeks we have rewritten large parts of the existing integration to
make it possible to integrate Kafka and QStash as well as creating new databases
and clusters on demand.

You can now select a Redis database and/or Kafka cluster as well as toggle
QStash for your projects.

If you don't have a database or cluster yet, the dropdown allows you to create a
new one on the fly.

The integration will set all required environment variables in your Vercel
project to get you up and running as fast as possible.

## Steps

0. Create an account on [upstash.com](https://console.upstash.com).
1. Head over to the [integration page](https://vercel.com/integrations/upstash)
   on Vercel and click `Add Integration`.
2. Select your resources and click `Create` at the bottom of the screen.
3. Redeploy your project to make the environment variables take effect.
