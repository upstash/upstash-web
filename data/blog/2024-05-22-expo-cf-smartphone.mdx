## Generate an OpenAI Token

Using OpenAI API, you are able to obtain vector embeddings of the articles, and create chatbot responses using AI. Any request to OpenAI API requires an authorization token. To obtain the token, navigate to the [API Keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) in your OpenAI account, and click the **Create new secret key** button. Copy and securely store this token for later use as **OPENAI_API_KEY** environment variable.

## Create an Upstash Vector Index

Once you have created an Upstash account and are logged in, go to the Vector tab and click on **Create Index** to start creating a vector index.

![Create an Upstash Vector](/blog/integrating-vector-search-in-e-commerce-platforms-with-upstash-vector/vector-tab.png)

Enter the index name of your choice (say, `smartphones`) and set the vector dimensions to be of 1536 (default).

![Create An Upstash Vector Index](/blog/expo-cf-smartphone/vector-index.png)

Now, scroll down till the **Connect** section, and click the **.env** button. Copy the contents, and save it somewhere safe to be used further in your application.

![Vector Index Environment Variables](/blog/expo-cf-smartphone/vector-env.png)

## Create a new Expo app

Let’s get started by creating a new Expo project. Open your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
npx create-expo-app@latest my-app
```

Once that is done, move into the project directory and start the app in developement mode by executing the following command:

```bash
cd my-app
npm run ios
```

The app should be running on [localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081). Stop the development server to install the necessary dependencies with following command:

```bash
npm install langchain@0.1.36 @langchain/openai@0.0.28 @langchain/community@0.0.55
npm install cheerio openai @upstash/vector
```

The command above installs the following packages:

- `langchain`: A framework for developing applications powered by language models.
- `@langchain/openai`: A LangChain package to interface with the OpenAI series of models.
- `@langchain/community`: A collection of third party integrations for plug-n-play with LangChain core.
- `openai`: A library to conveniently access OpenAI's REST API.
- `cheerio`: A library for parsing and manipulating HTML and XML.
- `@upstash/vector`: A connectionless (HTTP based) Vector client.

Now, create a `.env` file at the root of your project. You are going to add the secret keys obtained in the sections above.

The `.env` file should contain the following keys:

```bash
# File: .env

# OpenAI Environment Variable
OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."

# Upstash Redis Environment Variables
UPSTASH_VECTOR_REST_URL="https://...-us1-vector.upstash.io"
UPSTASH_VECTOR_REST_TOKEN="....=="
```

To create API endpoints in Expo, you will use Expo [Route Handlers](https://docs.expo.dev/router/reference/api-routes/#create-an-api-route) which allow you to serve responses over Web [Request](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Request) and [Response](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response) APIs. To start creating an API route in Expo that serve responses to the user, execute the following command:

```bash
mkdir app/api
mkdir lib
```

### Add NativeWind to the application

For styling the app, you will be using NativeWind. Install and set up NativeWind at the root of your project by running:

```bash
npm install nativewind@^4.0.1 react-native-reanimated tailwindcss
npx pod-install
```

The command above installs the following packages:

- `react-native-reanimated`: A re-implementation of React Native's Animated library.
- `tailwindcss`: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces.
- `nativewind`: A library to create a universal design system (powered with Tailwind CSS).

Then, create a `tailwind.config.js` file with the following code:

```js
// File: tailwind.config.js

module.exports = {
  content: ["./app/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}"],
  presets: [require("nativewind/preset")],
};
```

Then, create a file named `global.css` with the following code:

```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

Then, update the file `babel.config.js` with the following code:

```js
// File: babel.config.js

module.exports = function (api) {
  api.cache(true);
  return {
    presets: [
      ["babel-preset-expo", { jsxImportSource: "nativewind" }],
      "nativewind/babel",
    ],
  };
};
```

Then, create a file named `metro.config.js` with the following code:

```js
// File: metro.config.js

const { getDefaultConfig } = require("expo/metro-config");
const { withNativeWind } = require('nativewind/metro');

const config = getDefaultConfig(__dirname)

module.exports = withNativeWind(config, { input: './global.css' })
```

Then, create a file named `nativewind-env.d.ts` file with the following code:

```ts
/// <reference types="nativewind/types" />
```

Finally, update the file `app/_layout.tsx` with the following code:

```tsx
// File: app/_layout.tsx

import "@/global.css";
import { Slot } from "expo-router";

export default function Layout() {
  return <Slot />;
}
```

The `Slot` component takes care to render the content in files in the same (and nested) directories. So now the code in `app/index.tsx` when rendered will have the global CSS styles applied automatically.

## Prompt Meta Llama 3 with Cloudflare Workers AI

Inside the `my-app` directory, run the following command to spin up Cloudflare Workers project:

```bash
npm create cloudflare@latest cf-api
```

When prompted, choose:

- `"Hello World" Worker` for **What type of application do you want to create?**
- `Yes` for **Do you want to use TypeScript?**

Then, edit the `wrangler.toml` file and un-comment the following two lines:

```toml
[ai]
binding = "AI"
```

Finally, replace the code in `src/index.ts` with the following:

```ts
// File: src/index.ts

export interface Env {
	AI: any;
}

export default {
	async fetch(request, env): Promise<Response> {
		const { messages = [] } = (await request.json()) as { messages?: string[] };
		const response = await env.AI.run('@cf/meta/llama-3-8b-instruct', { messages });
		return Response.json(response);
	},
} satisfies ExportedHandler<Env>;
```

The code above uses the Cloudflare Workers AI to return a [chat completion response](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/models/llama-3-8b-instruct/#non-streaming-response) from Meta Llama 3 model.

Now, run the Cloudflare Workers locally via the following command:

```bash
npx wrangler dev
```

The workers should be running on [localhost:8787](http://localhost:8787). Let's keep it running while you proceed to create the API endpoints and UI in the Expo application.

## Create OpenAI API Embeddings Client

With `@langchain/openai` package, you are able to use the `OpenAIEmbeddings` class for generating vector embeddings of a given text. When combined with any LangChain Vector Store, the OpenAIEmbeddings class saves you from the process of creating and inserting each vector embedding on your own. With the following code in a file named `openai.server.ts` in the `lib` directory, we have instantiated the OpenAIEmbeddings class for further use to create vector embeddings under the hood.

```tsx
// File: lib/openai.server.ts

import { OpenAIEmbeddings } from '@langchain/openai'

// Instantiate class to generate embeddings using the OpenAI API
export default new OpenAIEmbeddings({
  modelName: 'text-embedding-3-small',
  openAIApiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
})
```

## Create Upstash Vector Client

Using `@upstash/vector` and `@langchain/community/vectorstores/upstash` packages, you are able to create a connectionless client in your Expo application that allows you to store, delete, and query vector embeddings from an Upstash Vector index. Create a file named `upstash.server.ts` in the `lib` directory with the following code:

```tsx
// File: lib/upstash.server.ts

import embeddings from './openai.server'
import { Index as UpstashIndex } from '@upstash/vector'
import { UpstashVectorStore } from '@langchain/community/vectorstores/upstash'

// Instantiate the Upstash Vector Index
const index = new UpstashIndex({
  url: process.env.UPSTASH_VECTOR_REST_URL as string,
  token: process.env.UPSTASH_VECTOR_REST_TOKEN as string,
})

// Instantiate the Upstash Vector Store that'll create and save embeddings
export default new UpstashVectorStore(embeddings, { index })
```

## Index Smartphones Webpages for Similarity Search

To be able to recommend smartphones relevant to the user query, you would need to build an index containing the vector embeddings alongwith the metadata, representing the marketing pages of various smartphone(s). Once indexed, smartphones are to be added to the chatbot's knowledge for creating personalized responses in the future user searches. Use the following code in a file named `digest+api.ts` in the `api` directory to accept multiple smartphone marketing URLs, fetch their content, generate their vector embeddings, and store them into the Upstash Vector Index dynamically.

```tsx
// File: app/api/digest+api.ts

import { Document } from "langchain/document";
import vectorStoreServer from "@/lib/upstash.server";
import { RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter } from "langchain/text_splitter";
import { CheerioWebBaseLoader } from "langchain/document_loaders/web/cheerio";

export async function POST(request: Request): Promise<Response> {
  // Set of messages between user and chatbot
  const { phones = [] } = await request.json();
  // Create the documents to be added to the Upstash Vector Store
  const documents: any[] = [];
  await Promise.all(
    phones.map(async (link: string) => {
      // Use the link to render in the search results
      // Parse the link using Cheerio
      const loader = new CheerioWebBaseLoader(link);
      const scraper = await loader.scrape();
      // Get the content of title tag to render in the search results
      const name = scraper("title").html();
      // Get the page content as string
      const pageContent = scraper.text();
      // Create metadata object to be inserted in the vector store
      const metadata = { link, name };
      documents.push(new Document({ pageContent, metadata }));
    })
  );
  const splitter = new RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter();
  const finalDocs = await splitter.splitDocuments(documents.filter(Boolean));
  // Creating embeddings from the provided documents along with metadata
  // and add them to Upstash database
  await vectorStoreServer.addDocuments(finalDocs, {
    ids: finalDocs.map((_, index) => index.toString()),
  });
  return Response.json({ code: 1 });
}
```

The code parses the smartphone marketing URL(s) sent in the rquest body as `phones`. Further, it creates a `pageContent` variable as the text content and `name` variable as title fetched from the marketing webpage. It then uses these variables to create [LangChain Document](https://js.langchain.com/docs/modules/data_connection/document_loaders/creating_documents) with the text content, reference and the name of the article (`new Document({ pageContent, metadata })`) for each page. Finally, all the documents stored in the global `documents` array are inserted into the Upstash Vector Index. Under the hood, the vector embeddings for each document is generated using it's `pageContent` property.

## Perform similarity search to obtain relevant smartphones recommendations

For the UI to fetch the response containing relevant smartphones, you are going to return the relevant information by creating an endpoint it can talk to. Such an endpoint would be responsible to search for the relevant smartphones based on the user prompt, including title, description and link(s). Create a file named `chat+api.ts` in the `app/api` directory with the following code:

```tsx
// File: app/api/chat+api.ts

import vectorStoreServer from "@/lib/upstash.server";

export async function POST(request: Request): Promise<Response> {
  // Set of messages between user and chatbot
  const { messages = [] } = await request.json();
  // Get the latest question stored in the last message of the chat array
  const searchQuery = messages[messages.length - 1].content;
  // Perform Similarity Search using the Upstash Vector Store
  const queryResult = await vectorStoreServer.similaritySearchWithScore(
    searchQuery,
    3
  );
  // Filter the records with confidence score > 70% and
  // set the metadata as response to render search results
  const results = queryResult
    .filter((i) => i[1] >= 0.7)
    .map((i) => i[0].metadata);
  // Now use OpenAI Text Completion with relevant articles as context
  const completionCall = await fetch("http://localhost:8787", {
    method: "POST",
    body: JSON.stringify({
      messages: [
        {
          // create a system content message to be added as
          // the open ai text completion will supply it as the context with the API
          role: "system",
          content: `Behave like a Google. You have the knowledge of the following smartphones: ${JSON.stringify(
            results
          )}. Each response should be in 100% markdown format and should have hyperlinks in it. Be precise. Do add some general text in the response related to the query.`,
        },
        // also, pass the whole conversation!
        ...messages,
      ],
    }),
    headers: {
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
    },
  });
  const completionResponse = await completionCall.json();
  return Response.json({ data: { content: completionResponse.response } });
}
```

The code above parses the request body to extract user's last message. It then queries the Upstash Vector index with the `similaritySearchWithScore` method, specifying to retrieve the top 3 relevant vectors along with their metadata. It then filters the results with a similarity score higher than 0.7, ensuring relevant smartphone recommendations are provided to the user. Finally, it uses the filtered information as the system context for the AI to do the following and return the response to the user:
  - Behave like a search engine for smartphones
  - Generate markdown compatible responses
  - Include hyperlinks to the smartphone(s) pages

With the code above, you are able to obtain results from Cloudflare Workers AI that are context aware, recommending smartphones found relevant to the user search.

## Build Conversational UI (with Smartphone Recommendations)

First, install the necessary libraries for building the conversational user interface:

```bash
npm install react-native-vercel-ai react-native-markdown-display
```

The above command installs the following:

- `react-native-vercel-ai`: A library to build AI-powered streaming text and chat UIs in native environments.
- `react-native-markdown-display`: A library for rendering markdown to HTML in native environments.

Next, to display smartphone recommendations in a visually appealing format, including titles and descriptions, create a `index.tsx` file inside the `app` directory with the following code:

```tsx
// File: app/index.tsx

import React from "react";
import { useChat } from "react-native-vercel-ai";
import Markdown from "react-native-markdown-display";
import { Pressable, Text, ScrollView, TextInput, View } from "react-native";

export default function App() {
  const { messages, input, handleInputChange, handleSubmit } = useChat({
    api: "http://localhost:8081/api/chat",
  });
  return (
    <ScrollView className="flex flex-1">
      <View className="flex flex-col px-8 py-12">
        {messages.map((m) => (
          <View
            key={m.id}
            className="flex flex-col gap-y-1 border-b border-gray-100 py-3"
          >
            <Text className="text-gray-600 capitalize">{m.role}</Text>
            <Markdown>{m.content}</Markdown>
          </View>
        ))}
        <TextInput
          value={input}
          placeholder="Say something..."
          // @ts-ignore
          onChangeText={(e) => handleInputChange(e)}
          className="mt-3 w-full p-2 border border-gray-300 rounded"
        />
        <Pressable
          onPress={(e) => handleSubmit(e)}
          className="w-[90px] border rounded px-3 py-1 bg-black mt-3"
        >
          <Text className="text-white">Show Me</Text>
        </Pressable>
      </View>
    </ScrollView>
  );
}
```

The code above does the following:

- Utilizes the `useChat` hook to manage chat functionality.
- Renders an input field for the user to describe the smartphone they're looking for and a button to submit the query.
- Upon submission, it sends the user input to the specified API endpoint (http://localhost:8081/api/chat).
- Renders the messages received from the API, displaying smartphone recommendations returned by the server.
- Smartphone recommendations are displayed with their title, description and link(s).
