Hey there, wonderful members of our Qstash community! We've had quite a busy month, and we're thrilled to share some updates with you all. Your voices and requests have been heard loud and clear, and we've been hard at work making Qstash even better for everyone.

**Ordered Delivery and Smarter Concurrency Control**

Ever wished for ordered delivery and the ability to limit concurrency to prevent overloading your endpoints? You're not alone! These features have been highly requested in our Discord channel, and we're delighted to announce that they're now part of Qstash.

Implementing these features took some time, but we wanted to ensure they were both reliable and user-friendly. 

Here,at last, introducing our latest API addition: **Qstash Queue!**

**Ordered Delivery: Keeping Things in Line**

With Qstash Queue, we've introduced ordered delivery by default. This means your messages will be queued and sent one by one, ensuring a smooth flow of data. Even if one message encounters an issue, like an unresponsive endpoint or an error, it will be retried until successful or moved to DLQ. During all these, all messages will wait patiently.

Setting up ordered delivery is as simple as choosing a queue name:

```bash
curl -XPOST -H 'Authorization: Bearer XXX' -H "Content-type: application/json" \
  'https://qstash.upstash.io/v2/enqueue/MY_QUEUE/https://example.com' -d {"data"}
```

See [the documentation](https://upstash.com/docs/qstash/features/queues#fifo) for more details

**Parallelism: Finding the Perfect Balance**

Need a bit of parallelism but want to keep it in check? Qstash Queue lets you configure the parallelism level to your liking: 


```bash 
curl -XPOST -H 'Authorization: Bearer XXX' \
  'https://qstash.upstash.io/v2/queue/ -d {"queue": "MY_QUEUE", "parallelism": 10}
```

Checkout our [documentation](https://upstash.com/docs/qstash/features/queues#parallelism) for more.

**Batch Processing: Efficiency at its Best**

Another highly requested feature was batch processing, aimed at boosting performance. Now, you can send batches of messages effortlessly. You can even combine  [topics](https://upstash.com/docs/qstash/features/topics) and [queues](https://upstash.com/docs/qstash/features/queues) with batching:

```bash
curl -XPOST https://qstash.upstash.io/v2/batch -H 'Authorization: Bearer XXX'  -H "Content-type: application/json" \
    -d '
     [
      {
        "destination": "https://example.com/destination1"
        "topic" : myTopic, 
        "body" : "message" 
      },
      {
        "destination": "https://example.com/destination2"
      },
      {
        "destination": "https://example.com/destination2"
        "queue": "MY_QUEUE"
      }
     ]'
```

**What's on the Horizon?**

But wait, there's more! We've got a bunch of exciting ideas in the pipeline, along with some fresh faces joining our team to help bring them to life:

- Revamping the UI for a more user-friendly experience.
- Considering supercharging DLQ and LOGS with advanced filtering options to both UI and Rest API.
- Adding more insightful content to schedules, both in the UI and Rest API.
- Creating a dedicated space for Queues, because they deserve it!
- And of course, a few surprises up our sleeves that we're keeping under wraps for now.
