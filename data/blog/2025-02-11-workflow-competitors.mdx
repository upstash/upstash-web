Hey there! In this post, we’re diving into a comparison of Upstash Workflow with two of its close competitors: Trigger.dev and Inngest. We’ll break down the key differences, pros, and cons of each platform to help you make the best choice for your needs. 
So, let’s see how these platforms stack up against each other!

The comparison will be based on three main aspects:
- [Features](#features)
- [Pricing](#pricing)
- [Limits](#limits)

## Features

All three products are serverless function orchestrators with batteries included. Together with the main feature, there come side features like flow-control, observability, etc. 
Here is an overall simplified diagram of the features of Upstash Workflow, Trigger.dev, and Inngest:

![Community](/blog/workflow-competitors/ComparisonDiagram.svg)

As you can see, the main features that they solve are quite similar. 
Upstash Workflow and Inngest share a similar approach to the problem, while Trigger.dev took a different path. They have decided to host users’ code on their server back in mid-2024 with their v3 release. You can read about their transition in their [blog post](https://trigger.dev/blog/v3-announcement#what-about-triggerdev-v2). 
- **The advantage**: An easier and more familiar API. No need to provide an API to split the code into steps, as all the code will run on their environment.
- **The downside**: You need to switch to Trigger.dev for your hosting environment. If you prefer another serverless environment like Vercel or Cloudflare Workers (see all Upstash supported platforms [here](https://upstash.com/docs/workflow/quickstarts/platforms)), Trigger.dev may not be an option. Alternatively, you would need to split your codebase into two different services.

Some small notes on the differentiators:
- **Offload Waiting for Third-Party Slow Services**:
    - Upstash Workflow:
        - We offer a general solution for any external URL with `context.call`.
        - We also have built-in integrations for some external APIs:
            - [OpenAI](https://upstash.com/docs/workflow/integrations/openai)
            - [Anthropic](https://upstash.com/docs/workflow/integrations/anthropic)
            - [Resend](https://upstash.com/docs/workflow/integrations/resend)
            - [Vercel AI SDK](https://upstash.com/docs/workflow/integrations/ai-sdk)
    - Inngest partially solved this for AI, but not for other services. See [here](https://www.inngest.com/docs/features/inngest-functions/steps-workflows/step-ai-orchestration).
    - Trigger.dev does not need to solve it since all the code runs on their environment. But the main differentiator here will be the limits and the pricing that they offer.

- **Agents API**: AI agents are autonomous intelligent systems that perform specific tasks without human intervention. The Agents API enables building these complex systems on serverless environments, reducing costs. All three services provide Agents APIs.
  An important note here for Trigger.dev is that it is missing Agent Tools, which are provided by Upstash and Inngest.
  And it does not have a specific API for AI agents, so using it will be a bit harder for AI agents.
  Links below for more information for each platform:
  - [Inngest AgentKit](https://agentkit.inngest.com/concepts/models)
  - [Upstash Workflow Agents](https://upstash.com/docs/workflow/agents/overview)
  - [Trigger.dev Agents](https://trigger.dev/docs/guides/ai-agents/overview)

Since the problems they solve are quite similar, it is not easy to decide by looking at the feature set.  
So, it makes sense to compare them via their limits and pricing.

## Pricing

All three platforms offer a free tier with limited executions per month. They all follow a pay-as-you-go pricing model, but there are some differences:

- Upstash Workflow and Inngest charge based on the number of executions.
- Trigger.dev charges based on execution time.

### Free Plan 
- [Upstash Workflow Pricing](https://upstash.com/pricing/workflow): 15K steps per month. No second limit on runs, but it can be a maximum of 15K runs per month.
- [Inngest Pricing](https://www.inngest.com/pricing): 250K steps per month. 50K runs/mo.
- [Trigger.dev Pricing](https://trigger.dev/pricing): They give $5 free monthly usage. This is a bit tricky, since they charge based on execution time. Plus, you need to choose a machine size which give you different cost per sec.
    After spending quite some time on it, I am skipping the details. I can say that, it is generous enough to get started and on par with the Upstash and Trigger.

### Paid Plans

Since all platforms have different parameters to calculate cost, it is not easy to compare. 
We will simulate a single scenario on each platform to compare the pricing.
- Use-case scenarios: 
    - __Case 1__: 1M runs with average 5 steps per run. (5M steps)
    - __Case 2__: 1M runs with average 10 steps per run. (10M steps)

We can say that in terms of predictabily and cost calculation, Upstash Workflow is the easiest to calculate. 
Inngest is also almost as easy as Upstash Workflow, but Trigger.dev is a bit harder to calculate.

Leaving the links to our calculations and pricing pages here so that you can compare and run different scenarios:
- [Trigger.dev](#triggerdev) ->https://trigger.dev/pricing
- [Upstash Workflow](#upstash-workflow) -> https://upstash.com/pricing/workflow
- [Inngest](#inngest) https://www.inngest.com/pricing

#### Trigger.dev

Assuming that this is a website deployed on Vercel,  
Trigger.dev will do most of the heavy lifting in terms of the function duration cost.  
So, I will assume that there will be no extra cost incurred by GB-hour on Vercel. 
The Pro package of Vercel is $20/mo, where 1M invocations are included.

With Trigger.dev, we need some willpower to calculate the cost. 
Depending on the machine size, the cost per second of run changes. 
The choice of the machine is probably determined by the RAM, which is mostly the libraries that are loaded. 
Let’s be generous here and assume that the small 1x will suffice. So, the cost per second is $0.0000338.    
But they also have a cost per run: $0.25 per 10,000 runs. So, a run costs $0.000025 without the cost of the seconds.

Trigger.dev cost =  
If a run takes `x` seconds, the cost of the 1M runs will be ($0.000025 + $0.0000338 * x) * 1M.  
  - 100 ms: ($0.000025 + $0.0000338 * 0.1) * 1M ~= $28.38  
  - 1 sec: ($0.000025 + $0.0000338 * 1) * 1M ~= $58.80  
  - 1 min: ($0.000025 + $0.0000338 * 60) * 1M ~= $2,053.00  

Vercel Cost = $20 

A note here about how long the runs can take. Trigger.dev has a checkpoint mechanism where they are hibernating 
the system when the run is waiting. But it looks limited for now. They don't solve it for 
external Rest API calls([yet](https://trigger.dev/docs/wait-for-request)). And they don't seem to solve it for 
[AI Agents](https://trigger.dev/docs/guides/ai-agents/overview) as well.
But for now, be aware of your run duration and the cost of it.

To summarize, total cost could be $48 to $2,093 depending on how long the runs are.

#### Upstash Workflow

Upstash Workflow charges $1 per 100K steps. And the pay-as-you-go model allows 500K steps per day, which is 15M per month.  
This is more than our scenarios.

__Case 1:__ 1M runs with average 5 steps per run

Upstash Cost = 5M steps / 100K steps * $1 = $50  

__Case 2:__ 1M runs with average 10 steps per run

Upstash Cost = 10M steps / 100K steps * $1 = $100

We also need to consider the cost of the deployed envrinment. Again, we are assuming that this is a website deployed on Vercel.
Function Duration Cost will be small as Upstash Workflow allows offloading REST API calls. 
Note that users need to be careful here. If you use an SDK instead of a REST API, you cannot offload the call.
Vercel on the Pro plan gives 1,000 GB-hour/month included, then $0.18 per GB-hour.
Let’s assume a 128 MB function size and 500ms duration per call.  
5M calls * 128 MB * 500ms = 320 GB-hour, which is included in the Pro plan.
10M calls * 128 MB * 500ms = 640 GB-hour, which is also included in the Pro plan.

Vercel Cost = $20 

Total cost will be 
- $70($50+$20) for 1M runs with average 5 steps per run
- $120($100+$20) for 1M runs with average 10 steps per run

#### Inngest

Inngest costs $5 per 50K runs (starts after 100K runs) and $4 per 50K steps (starts after 500K steps).  
And they also have averate of 5 steps per run included for free.
There is also a base price of $50/$350 per month depending on the plan.

Their pricing is a bit more complicated than Upstash Workflow, to accomodate they have a pricing calculator on their pricing page.

Let's try to run same scenarios on Inngest. 
As far as I understand the calculator, they take the minimum of the totals costs depending of the plans, and apply that only.

__Case 1:__ 1M runs with average 5 steps per run

Inngest Cost = $50(base price) +  = $50 + $90
   - Base Price = $50(base price) 
  - Run Cost = (1M - 100K(free-runs)) * $5/50K) = $90
  - Step Cost = 0$ (as averange of 5 steps per run is included)
  - Total =  = $50 + $90 = $140

__Case 2:__ 1M runs with average 10 steps per run

Inngest Cost(Basic Plan) = Base Price + Run Cost + Step Cost
  - Base Price = $50
  - Run Cost = (1M - 100K(free-runs)) * $5/50K) = $90
  - Step Cost =  (5M(additional steps) * $4/50K) = $400
  - Total =  = $50 + $90 + $400 = $540
Inngest Cost(Pro Plan) = $350(base price) + 0(for runs as 5M run sare included) + (5M(additional steps) * $4/200K)= $350 + $100 = $450
  - Base Price = $350
  - Run Cost = $0(5M run sare included in this plan)
  - Step Cost =  (5M(additional steps) * $4/200K) = $100
  - Total = = $350 + $100 = $450
Applied Inngest Cost = min($540, $450) = $450

Here, the function duration costs will be higher than Upstash Workflow because Inngest does not have a feature to offload REST API calls.  
But the cost of Inngest is already higher than Upstash Workflow. Let's assume same Vercel cost as same as Upstash Workflow with a warning.

Vercel Cost = $20 

Total cost will be 
- $160($140+$20) for 1M runs with average 5 steps per run
- $470($450+$20) for 1M runs with average 10 steps per run
*with a warning that Vercel Function Duration Cost can be higher due to not having option of offloading Rest Calls.

### Pricing Conclusion

We looked at the costs of each platform with 5M steps per month, let’s say 5 steps per run. 

Although Trigger.dev can be the most cost-effective, Upstash Workflow is close. 
And when compared to the $70/$170 predictable cost versus $48-$2,093 of Trigger.dev, Upstash Workflow would be a better choice. 

And when we compare Inngest, Upstash Workflow is also a better choice with
- $70 cost of a Upstash Workflow compared to $160 for Inngest.
- $120 cost of a Upstash Workflow compared to $470 for Inngest.

### Limits

There are a few limits that you should be aware of when choosing a platform. We will focus on the most important ones here:
- Concurrent executions: 
  - Inngest has a limit of 25/200 concurrent executions depending on the plan ($10 per 10 after this limit).
  - Trigger.dev says 25/100+ concurrent executions depending on the plan.
  - Upstash Workflow doesn’t have a hard limit on concurrent executions. 
- Maximum run length: 
  - Inngest has a limit of 90 days/366 days depending on the plan.
  - Trigger.dev has no documentation on a limit and has a `no timeout` slogan. So, assuming that there is no limit.
  - Upstash Workflow has a limit of 1 year on the pay-as-you-go plan. Unlimited on the fixed pricing plan (starting from $180).
- Schedules: 
  - Inngest doesn’t have documentation on schedules (limitless?).
  - Trigger.dev has a limit of 100 schedules.
  - Upstash Workflow offers 1,000 schedules free and can increase ($0.01 per active schedule).

Again, leaving the links to pricing pages here so that you can check different limits, 
as depending on the use case, none of the limits may be important.
