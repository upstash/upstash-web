Recently, we have announced Upstash Redis on Fly.io: [Upstash Redis on Fly](https://fly.io/docs/reference/redis/)

Sidekiq is a background processing library in Ruby language. With this library, we can distribute our processes to what is called `Sidekiq workers` instead of doing the heavy work on the server itself. 

What these workers do basically is they fetch the enqueued or scheduled tasks from the database. Then, execute them whenever the time comes and the worker is idle.

This way, we can make sure that our server remains responsive for incoming requests, without being blocked by heavy or recurring processes.

We will create a sample app using Sidekiq on Fly.io using Upstash Redis. It will enqueue and/or schedule some notification for users, depending on the inputs provided.

## Fly.io Setup
- Create a [Fly.io](https://fly.io/) account.
- Install [flyctl](https://fly.io/docs/getting-started/installing-flyctl/) and
run `flyctl auth login`

## Upstash Redis Setup on Fly
- Run `flyctl redis create`.
- Set your connection link (after the `.toml` creation): `flyctl secrets set UPSTASH_REDIS_LINK=<upstash-redis-connection-link>`

## Application Code
- `bundle init` and `bundle add sidekiq sinatra` to initiate Gemfile and install dependencies.
`
- Create `sendEmail.rb` file:

```ruby
require "sidekiq"
require "sidekiq/api"

connection_url = ENV['UPSTASH_REDIS_LINK']

Sidekiq.configure_client do |config|
    config.redis = {url: connection_url}
end

Sidekiq.configure_server do |config|
    config.redis = {url: connection_url}
end

class EmailService
    include Sidekiq::Worker
    def perform(id, type)
        # Logic goes here. Let's assume sending email by printing to console.
        puts "Emailed to: " +  id + ": " + "'Congrats on " + type + " plan.'"
    end
end

def updateEmail(id, newType)
    jobFound = false
    
    a = Sidekiq::ScheduledSet.new
    a.each do |job|
        if job.args[0] == id
            job.delete
            jobFound = true
        end
    end

    if jobFound
        EmailService.perform_async(id, ("starting using our service and upgrading it to " + newType))
    else
        EmailService.perform_async(id, ("upgrading to " + newType))
    end
end

def sendEmail(id, type)
    case type
    when "free"
        # if free, delay for 10 seconds.
        EmailService.perform_in("10", id, "free")
    when "paid"
        # if paid, delay for 5 seconds.
        EmailService.perform_in("5", id, "paid")
    when "enterprise"
        # if enterprise, immediately queue.
        EmailService.perform_async(id, "enterprise")
    when "enterprise10k"
        EmailService.perform_async(id, "enterprise10k")
    else
        puts "Only plans are: `free`, `paid` and `enterprise`"
    end
end

def clearSchedules()
    Sidekiq::ScheduledSet.new.clear
    Sidekiq::Queue.new.clear
end
```

- Create a simple Sinatra server `app.rb`:
```ruby
#!/usr/bin/env ruby

require 'rubygems'
require 'bundler/setup'
require 'sinatra'
require './sendEmail.rb'

get '/register/:id/:plan' do
  sendEmail(params[:id], params[:plan])
  "<h1>Email is queued.</h1>"
end

get '/update/:id/:plan' do
  updateEmail(params[:id], params[:plan])
  "<h1>Updated Email is queued.</h1>"
end

get '/clear' do
  clearSchedules()
  "<h1>Queue and the schedules are cleared.</h1>"
end
```

- Create `config.ru` file:
```ruby
# config.ru

require './app.rb'
require 'sidekiq'
require "sidekiq/api"

run Sinatra::Application
```
## Launch App
- First, run `flyctl launch` to create `.toml` template. 
- There, update `internal_port = 9292` under `[[services]]`. It should look something like this:
``` ruby
app = "sidekiq-example"
kill_signal = "SIGINT"
kill_timeout = 5
processes = []

[build]
  builder = "heroku/buildpacks:20"

[env]
  PORT = "8080"

[[services]]
  internal_port = 9292
  protocol = "tcp"
  [services.concurrency]
    hard_limit = 25
    soft_limit = 20
    type = "connections"

  [[services.ports]]
    handlers = ["http"]
    port = 80

  [[services.ports]]
    handlers = ["tls", "http"]
    port = 443
```
- Create a file named `Procfile` so that we can run both the Sinatra server and the Sidekiq Worker:
```ruby
web: bundle exec rackup & bundle exec sidekiq -r ./sendEmail.rb
```

- run `flyctl deploy` to deploy.

## App Deployed
- send `get register/id1/enterprise` via `curl <fly-domain>/register/:id/:plan`
![enterprise](/blog/sidekiq-fly/enterprise.png)


- send `get register/id2/paid` via `curl <fly-domain>/register/:id/:plan`
![paid](/blog/sidekiq-fly/paid.png)


- send `get register/id3/free` and then `get update/id3/paid` via `curl <fly-domain>/register/:id/:plan` and `curl <fly-domain>/update/:id/:newPlan`
![register-update](/blog/sidekiq-fly/register-update.png)


### Closing Words
In this example, we have implemented an app, using Sidekiq background processing library. In the sample, we have demonstrated a simple usecase which you can customize depending on your needs. This way, we have decreased the workload of our main server and with that enabled for more responsive experience for users.

For the complete source code, you can look at [our repo](https://github.com/upstash/redis-examples/tree/compatible-libraries/using-sidekiq).
