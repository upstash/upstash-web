A while ago, we had the opportunity to collab with Drizzle ORM.

Seeing how this TypeScript ORM is absolutely loved by the community, our decision to say "yes ðŸ˜³" was a no-brainer:

In this article, we'll see how our Upstash Redis x Drizzle caching integration improves SQL performance, and how we used Lua scripts and hash data structure to optimize the integration.

---

## The Challenge: SQL Performance in Modern Applications

Traditional SQL databases are great at consistency and modeling complex relationships, but they can struggle with:

- **High latency** in distributed environments
- **Connection pooling limitations** in serverless functions
- **Repetitive query overhead** for frequently accessed data
- **Scaling bottlenecks** under heavy read loads

The solution? A caching layer that understands your data relationships and automatically manages cache invalidation.

---

## How the Upstash x Drizzle Caching Works

### Improving Read Performance: Cache-First with Fallback

When you execute a query with Drizzle caching enabled, our integration first checks Redis for a cached result:
  - **Cache Miss**: If not found, the query reads from your database. The result is stored in Redis with metadata about dependent tables
  - **Cache Hit**: Subsequent identical queries return instantly from Redis without having to read from the relational database

```typescript
// This query checks Redis first and only reads from the database if needed
const users = await db.select().from(usersTable)
  .where(eq(usersTable.status, 'active'))
  .$withCache();
```

---

### Smart Invalidation for Write Operations

The magic happens during write operations. When you modify data in your relational database, our integration automatically:

1. **Identifies Dependencies**: Determines which cached queries depend on the modified tables
2. **Batch Invalidation**: Removes all affected cache entries

```typescript
// This insert automatically invalidates all cached queries that depend on usersTable
await db.insert(usersTable).values({ 
  email: 'new@user.com', 
  status: 'active' 
});
```

---

## Building a Simple Cache: The "Naive" Approach

Let's start with the simplest possible implementation to understand the problems our caching integration solves. When caching a query result, we need to:

1. Store the cached value
2. Track which tables this query depends on for invalidation

### Simple Cache Storage

```typescript
// When adding an item to the cache
await redis.set(itemHash, cachedValue);
await Promise.all(
  dependentTables.map((table) => redis.sadd(table, itemHash))
);
```

This approach stores the cached result as a key-value pair and tracks dependencies by adding the item hash to sets named after each dependent table.

### Simple Cache Invalidation

```typescript
// When invalidating based on table changes
const hashesToInvalidate = await redis.sunion(dependentTables);
await redis.del(...hashesToInvalidate);
```

This works by finding all cached items that depend on the modified tables, then deleting them.

---

## The Problems with this "Naive" Approach

While it technically works, this naive implementation has two performance issues.

### Problem 1: Multiple Round Trips

The invalidation process requires **two separate Redis operations**:
1. First, we call `SUNION` to get the list of keys to delete
2. Then, we call `DEL` with the result from step 1

This creates a **round-trip dependency** where the second operation must wait for the first to complete.

### Problem 2: Slow Mass Deletion

The `DEL` command can become a bottleneck when invalidating many keys:

```typescript
// This could potentially delete thousands of keys
await redis.del(...hashesToInvalidate);
```

When you have a popular table like `users` that's referenced by hundreds of cached queries, a single update could trigger the deletion of hundreds of individual Redis keys. With hundreds or thousands of keys, this can potentially become too slow.

---

## Solution 1: Lua Scripts

Upstash Redis has full support for Lua script evaluation.

Lua scripts solve the round-trip problem by executing multiple Redis commands on the server side:

```lua
-- Invalidation script that combines SUNION and DEL
local tables = KEYS  -- table names passed as keys
local keysToDelete = {}

if #tables > 0 then
  -- Get all hashes that depend on these tables
  local hashesToInvalidate = redis.call('SUNION', unpack(tables))
  
  -- Prepare for deletion
  for _, hash in ipairs(hashesToInvalidate) do
    keysToDelete[#keysToDelete + 1] = hash
  end
  
  -- Add table sets themselves to deletion list
  for _, table in ipairs(tables) do
    keysToDelete[#keysToDelete + 1] = table
  end
  
  -- Single atomic deletion
  if #keysToDelete > 0 then
    redis.call('DEL', unpack(keysToDelete))
  end
end
```

**Benefits of Lua scripts:**
- **Single round trip**: All operations happen server-side
- **Reduced latency**: No network overhead between operations
- **Consistency**: No risk of partial updates due to network issues

---

## Solution 2: Hash-Based Storage for Efficient Deletion

Even with Lua scripts, deleting hundreds of individual keys may be slower than we would like. Redis hashes provide a much more efficient solution:

### The Hash-Based Approach

Instead of storing each cached query as a separate Redis key, we group queries depending on the same tables into hashes:

```typescript
// Old approach: Each query gets its own key
await redis.set('query_hash_1', result1);
await redis.set('query_hash_2', result2);
await redis.set('query_hash_3', result3);

// New approach: Group queries by table dependencies
const compositeKey = 'users,posts'; // hash key for users and posts tables
await redis.hset(compositeKey, {
  'query_hash_1': result1,
  'query_hash_2': result2,
  'query_hash_3': result3
});
```

### Why Hashes Are Much Faster

When invalidating queries that depend on the `users` table:

```typescript
// Old way: Delete many individual keys (slow)
await redis.del('query_hash_1', 'query_hash_2', /* ...hundreds more... */);

// New way: Delete entire hash table (fast)
await redis.del('__CT__users,posts');
```

**Performance advantages:**
- **Single deletion operation**: One `DEL` command removes hundreds of cached queries
- **Memory efficiency**: Redis can free entire hash tables in one operation
- **Atomic cleanup**: All related queries are invalidated together

To see what the Lua scripts look like in the end, you can check the implementation in the [Drizzle repository](https://github.com/drizzle-team/drizzle-orm/blob/ac1dcd9d1c4b8f171479af4a5dd731db1e164f58/drizzle-orm/src/cache/upstash/cache.ts#L1).

## Advanced Techniques: Tags and Auto-Invalidation

### Cache Tags for Granular Control

Beyond table-based invalidation, Drizzle supports custom tags for fine-grained cache control:

```typescript
// Cache with a custom tag
const premiumUsers = await db.select().from(usersTable)
  .where(eq(usersTable.plan, 'premium'))
  .$withCache({ tag: 'premium_users' });

// Later, invalidate just this specific query
await db.$cache?.invalidate({ tags: 'premium_users' });
```

### Auto vs Manual Invalidation

**Automatic Invalidation** (default): Queries are invalidated when dependent tables change, ensuring data consistency but with more aggressive cache clearing.

**Manual Invalidation**: For scenarios where eventual consistency is acceptable, you can disable auto-invalidation and manually control when to clear the cache:

```typescript
// Won't be automatically invalidated - good for analytics data
const monthlyStats = await db.select()
  .from(analyticsTable)
  .$withCache({ autoInvalidate: false });

// Manually invalidate when needed (e.g., daily batch job)
await db.$cache?.invalidate({ tables: ['analyticsTable'] });
```

---

## Real-World Use Cases

Now that we've covered the technical side of the integration, let's see how these concepts translate into practical applications.

### E-commerce Product Catalog

```typescript
// Cache product listings with automatic invalidation
const products = await db.select()
  .from(productsTable)
  .where(eq(productsTable.active, true))
  .$withCache({ tag: 'active_products' });

// When inventory changes, cache is automatically invalidated
await db.update(productsTable)
  .set({ stock: newStock })
  .where(eq(productsTable.id, productId));
```

### Content Management

```typescript
// Cache published articles with manual invalidation
const articles = await db.select()
  .from(articlesTable)
  .where(eq(articlesTable.status, 'published'))
  .$withCache({ 
    autoInvalidate: false,
    tag: 'published_articles'
  });

// Manually invalidate when content is updated
await db.$cache?.invalidate({ tags: 'published_articles' });
```
