Cloudflare has recently released the Upstash Integration for the Cloudflare Workers. This makes it even easier to use Upstash products on Workers. In this blog post, we're going use Upstash Redis integration to build a serverless URL shortener.

## Getting Started

Here are the steps of building this project:

-   Set up an Upstash database
-   Create the Worker on Cloudflare
-   Integrate Cloudflare Workers with Upstash
-   Implement the project algorithm.
-   Deploy your application

### Creating the database

Navigate to [Upstash console](https://console.upstash.com), and create yourself a Redis database by clicking the **Create database** button in the **Redis** section.

Just like that, your database is all set!

### Creating the Cloudflare Worker

We're going to use the Cloudflare CLI tool to generate the Worker. It's a pretty simple process. Just open your terminal and type in the command below:

```
npm create cloudflare@latest
```

Executing this command will lead you through the options and configurations for the application. Finally, it will request you to log in to Cloudflare. Below is an example of my configuration and the resultant output:

```text
$ npm create cloudflare@latest

using create-cloudflare version 2.1.0

```

We've created and deployed the application using a single line command. This command should have initialized a folder similar to this:

```shell title="/url-shortener"
src
└── worker.ts
node_modules
package-lock.json
package.json
tsconfig.json
wrangler.toml
```

Enabling Upstash integration will be equally straightforward.

### Cloudflare - Upstash Integration

Access to the [Cloudflare Dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com) and login with the same account that you've created the `url-shortener` application. Then, navigate to the **Workers & Pages > Overview** section of the sidebar. Here, you will find the `url-shortener` application listed.

![Cloudflare workers](/blog/cloudflare-url-shortener/cloudflare-workers.png)

Clicking on the application will direct you to the application details page, where we will perform the integration process. Switch to the **Settings** tab in the application details, and proceed to **Integrations** section. You will see various Worker integrations listed. To proceed, click the **Add Integration** button associated with the Upstash Redis.

![Add integration](/blog/cloudflare-url-shortener/add-integration.png)

On the Integration page, connect to your Upstash account. Then, select the `url-shortener` database from the dropdown menu. Finalize the process by pressing **Save button**.

**Note:** Please don't make any changes in the secret names on the **Configure secrets** step. These credentials will be automatically picked up by `Redis.fromEnv(env)` line in the code as `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL` and `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN`.

### Implementing URL Shortener

Our implementation will rather be a simple one. It will have two functionalities:

-   When a URL is sent using the POST method, a randomly generated key will be assigned to that URL. This key-URL pair will be stored in Redis for retrieval. The key will be appended as a path to the Worker URL and sent to the user in the `<YOUR_WORKER_URL>/<KEY>` format.

-   When user accesses the Worker URL with previously added key as a path, corresponding value of the key will be retrieved from Redis. The user will then be redirected to this URL with a `307` response code.

We will implement the application in the `src/worker.ts` file. Below is the basic implementation of our URL Shortener:

```typescript title="src/worker.ts"
import { Redis } from "@upstash/redis/cloudflare";

export interface Env {
    UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL: string;
    UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN: string;
}

export default {
    async fetch(
        request: Request,
        env: Env,
        ctx: ExecutionContext
    ): Promise<Response> {
        const redis = Redis.fromEnv(env);

        /*
        generateRandomKey function returns a 7 digit alphanumerical key.
		If an identical key exists in Redis, it will create new key.
		*/
        async function generateRandomKey(): Promise<string> {
			const key: string = btoa(crypto.getRandomValues(new Uint8Array(2)).toString()).replaceAll("=","")
			if (await redis.exists(key)) {
				return generateRandomKey();
			}
			return key;
		}

        /*
		If the request method is POST, "longUrl" field will be extracted from
          the request body and new key will be generated for this url.
        Then, this key-value pair will be persisted to Redis.
		*/
        if (request.method === "POST") {
            const requestUrl = request.url;
            const body = await request.text();
            const { longUrl } = JSON.parse(body);
            const key = await generateRandomKey();
            redis.set(key, longUrl);

            const responseUrl = requestUrl + key;
            return new Response(responseUrl);
        }

        const slug: string = request.url.split("/").pop() || "";
        const url = (await redis.get(slug)) as string;

        /*
		If the slug exists in the Redis DB as key, user will be redirected to URL in the value.
	    If the slug doesn't exist in the Redis, or it doesn't exist at all,
          an error will be returned.
	    */
        if (url) {
            return Response.redirect(url, 307);
        } else {
            const errorText = !slug
                ? "Please provide a slug."
                : `Slug ${slug} not found. `;

            return new Response(errorText, { status: 404 });
        }
    },
};
```

Now that our algorithm is ready, there's only one step left: deploying the application. Navigate to `url-shortener` folder from the terminal, and run the command below:

```shell
npm run deploy
```

Our Cloudflare Worker is now up and running! You can test it either in the application dashboard, or via a curl request. Here's an example request for you. You can replace the URL with your Worker URL, or test with my implementation:

```shell
curl -X POST https://url-shortener.fahreddin.workers.dev \
	-d '{ "longUrl" : "https://google.com" }'
```

Clicking on the response URL will redirect you to **https://google.com**.

## Conclusion

Thank you for following along the tutorial!

As you've discovered, the combination of serverless functions and the power of Upstash Redis opens up a world of possibilities for your projects. The versatility and efficiency of this pair empower you to create solutions that are not only innovative but also remarkably responsive.

Remember, this guide is just the beginning. There's no limit to how you can expand and improve this project.
