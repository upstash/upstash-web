The most common business model in building a SaaS is a subscription model where users pay a certain fee to use your service in a specified time interval. In this article, we will go through the process of adding a subscription service to a NextJS project and the best practices to follow once going into production.

Our SaaS will be helping our users to get a daily dose of motivational quotes every morning in their email at a fee of say, $1 per month.

To create your project, paste this command on your terminal and choose Prisma as your ORM; you can opt-out of the rest of the tools. In case you're not familiar with create-t3-app, it is one of the easiest ways to start a nextJS app and add tools like Drizzle, Prisma, trpc, and tailwind. I will be using the Pages router in this article.

```
pnpm create t3-app@latest
```

## Data Modelling

Good data modeling will make your application grow easier and managing your database even more seamless.
Let's start by first adding the data modeling for our quotes to be sent to our users. Open the schema.prisma
file located in your prisma directory and add the following. I will be using postgres but implementation in other
databases will be fairly the same.

```title:"schema.prisma"
model Quotes {
   name String
   id   Int    @id @default(autoincrement())
   body String
}

model Users {
   name          String
   email         String @unique
   id            Int    @id @default(autoincrement())
   payments      Payments[]
   subscriptions Subscriptions[]
}
```

On our users' side, we are recording their name, email, every payment they have made, and their subscription status.
Let's go ahead and add the last two.

```title:"schema.prisma"
model Payments {
    id        Int    @id @default(autoincrement())
    userId    Int
    amount    Float
    createdAt String
    User      Users  @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])
}

model Subscriptions {
    id              Int     @id @default(autoincrement())
    userId          Int     @unique
    expiryDate      String
    subscribed       Boolean @default(false)
    daysWithService Int     @default(0)
    User            Users   @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])
}
```

We are recording the payment details that we get from our payment provider to track when a
particular user paid for a service in case they ask for a refund or whatnot. The subscription table
is where we will check whether this user is currently subscribed to our service. The `daysWithService` column
is what we will be using to count how many days (or any time interval) this user has used our service.

To deploy your database, you must configure your database URL depending on where you host your database.
I won't go into the details of hosting your database in this article.

## Recording Payments Details

For us to be able to receive money from our users, we need to set up our payment provider.
There are different options depending on your location. If you're in the US, UK, or Canada you can
go ahead with Stripe, as it is fairly easy to integrate with different components and setting up
webhooks is relatively easy. If you're in Africa I would recommend choosing DPO Payments as it is available
in many countries as compared to Flutterwave and other providers. The choice you make here depends on your
business requirements and where you are located.

All providers will allow you to configure a webhook that they can ping every time someone makes a payment
to your account, so go ahead and implement that. Let's say your webhook URL is `https://www/yourDomain.com/api/payments`,
go ahead and create a `payment.ts` file at the API directory of your application.

```typescript title:"/api/payment.ts"
import { type NextApiRequest, type NextApiResponse } from "next";

function addMonth(dateObj: Date, num: number) {
  dateObj.setMonth(dateObj.getMonth() + num);
  const dateString = dateObj?.toISOString()?.split("T")[0];
  if (dateString) {
    return dateString.replace(/-/g, "/");
  }
  return "";
}

export default async function postRequest(
  req: NextApiRequest,
  res: NextApiResponse,
) {
  if (req.method === "POST") {
    const data = req.body;

    try {
      // find the userId
      const userId = await prisma.users
        .findUnique({
          where: {
            email: data.email,
          },
        })
        .then((user) => {
          return user?.id as number;
        });

      // use the userId to insert it on the payments table
      const date = new Date()
        ?.toISOString()
        ?.split("T")[0]
        ?.replaceAll("-", "/") as string;
      if (userId) {
        const newPayment = await prisma.payments.create({
          data: {
            userId: userId,
            amount: parseFloat(data.TransactionAmount),
            createdAt: date,
          },
        });

        // record the Subscription table
        // HANDLE WHEN A USER MAKES 2 PAYMENTS IN A ROW
        const nextMonth: string = addMonth(new Date(), 1);

        // check if the farmer is there in subscription table
        const subscribedUser = await prisma.subscriptions.findUnique({
          where: {
            userId: userId,
          },
        });

        if (subscribedUser) {
          const updatedSubscription = await prisma.subscriptions.update({
            where: {
              userId: userId,
            },
            data: {
              expiryDate: nextMonth,
              subscribed: true,
              daysWithService: subscribedUser.daysWithService + 31,
            },
          });
        } else {
          const newSubscription = await prisma.subscriptions.create({
            data: {
              expiryDate: nextMonth,
              userId,
              subsribed: true,
              daysWithService: 31,
            },
          });
        }
      } else {
        // probably the userId wasnt found and we can just record the number on the users table
        const newUser = await prisma.users.create({
          data: {
            email: data?.email,
            name: data?.CustomerName,
          },
        });
      }
    } catch (error) {
      console.log(error);
    }

    // make sure to send a response back according to your payment provider
  }
}
```

What we did here is we took the response we got back from our payment provider, extracted the userId
from the email that we got back and recorded the payments in our table as well as managing the subscription
logic in our table. We also handled the case where the user has made multiple payments in a row on how it will
affect the subscription. We also add daysWithService table as 31 meaning this user is subscribed to the service
for the next month. Ensure you check the data shape your payment provider returns and adjust the above code accordingly.

## Adding CRON Jobs with Upstash

The last piece of the puzzle is adding CRON jobs to our SaaS. The main point of adding the CRON
jobs is to unsubscribe the user from getting our service once the subscription ends.

To achieve this, we will be using upstash Qstash Service. Go ahead and create an account and head over
to Qstash in your dashboard. You will be prompted with UI to publish your messages.
On the Endpoint section, add your URL `https://www/yourDomain.com/api/updateSubscription`, type Choose Once and specify every midnight, and click schedule. This will hit your specified endpoint every midnight and allow us to trigger a database update.

Go ahead and create a `updateSubscription.ts` file at the API folder.

```javascript title:"/api/updateSubscription.ts"
import { type NextApiRequest, type NextApiResponse } from "next";

export default async function updatedSubscription(
  req: NextApiRequest,
  res: NextApiResponse,
) {
  try {
    // Go through the subscribers table and check if the subscription is still active
    //if it is not active, update the subscription status to false
    const currentSubscribers = await prisma.subscriptions.findMany({});

    // Update where the daysWithService == 0 and cancel the days of Subscription
    const subscribers = await prisma.subscriptions.updateMany({
      where: {
        daysWithService: {
          equals: 0,
        },
      },
      data: {
        subsribed: false,
        daysWithService: 0,
      },
    });

    // If the daysOfService is not 0 then reduce the daysWithService by 1
    const updatingDays = currentSubscribers.forEach(async (sub) => {
      const { subsribed, daysWithService } = sub;
      if (subsribed && daysWithService > 0) {
        await prisma.subscriptions.update({
          where: {
            id: sub.id,
          },
          data: {
            daysWithService: (sub.daysWithService -= 1),
          },
        });
      }
    });

    res.status(200).json({ message: "Message Received" });
  } catch (cause) {
    res.status(500).json({ message: "Failed to send the message" });
    console.log(cause);
  }
}
```

Here, we go and update our subscription table according to the remaining days of service.
If the daysOfService is less than or equal to zero, we set the isSubscribed field to false meaning
the user subscription has expired, otherwise we reduce the daysOfService by 1.

And those are all the pieces required to add a subscription service to a SaaS.

I hope you enjoyed it.
