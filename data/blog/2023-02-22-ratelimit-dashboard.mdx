[@upstash/ratelimit](https://github.com/upstash/ratelimit) is getting more and more popular and we've been getting a lot of feedback on how to make it better. One of the most requested features was a way to get a better view of the overall performance and how limits apply to different users in your application. We're excited to announce our [new dashboard](https://console.upstash.com/rate-limit).

In case you are not familiar with `@upstash/ratelimit`, it is a typescript library, that allows you to easily add rate limiting to your application. It is built on top of [Upstash Redis](https://upstash.com/) and works over HTTP, so it's perfect for stateless runtimes like serverless and edge.
If you want to learn more about how it works, you can read the [announcement](/blog/upstash-ratelimit) or check out the [repository](https://github.com/upsatsh/ratelimit).

## Enabling Analytics

Enabling ratelimit analytics does not add any latency to the critical path of your application and is completely optional.
You can opt into analytics, by configuring it in the `Ratelimit` constructor:


```ts
import { Ratelimit } from "@upstash/ratelimit";
import { Redis } from "@upstash/redis";

const ratelimit = new Ratelimit({
  redis: Redis.fromEnv(),
  limiter: Ratelimit.fixedWindow(10, "10 s"),
  analytics: true // <- add this line
});

```


## Console

Once you have enabled analytics, you can access the dashboard by going to [console.upstash.com/rate-limit](https://console.upstash.com/rate-limit).

Afterwards you need to select the database that you are using for rate limitting.

## Pricing

Using the `@upstash/ratelimit` sdk and console is 100% free. You only pay for the underlying database that is used to store the limits and analytics data.
One of the main requirements for the analytics addon was to make it as cheap as possible. Recording a single ratelimit event for analytics requires only one billable `request`.

Our Redis free tier allows **10,000** requests **per day** for free. If you need more, you can upgrade and pay **$0.20** per **100,000** requests.
