## What is changing?

We're increasing the limits for Upstash Redis for the [second time in 2 months](https://upstash.com/blog/redis-new-pricing).

| Limit | Old  | New  |
|-------|-----------|-----------|
| Max throughput (tps) | 1k | 10k  |
| Max request size | 1MB | 10MB |
| Max concurrent connections | 1k | 10k |


All plans that previously had lower limits — including Free, Pay-as-You-Go, and Fixed Plans — now have access to the new, higher limits.

## Why are we increasing the limits?

Some users who experienced sudden traffic spikes ran into issues during the upgrade process. We're increasing our limits to reduce friction during high-load situations. A serverless database should handle variable workloads without hitting restrictive limits.

---

## Why did/do we have limits?

Serverless applications scale well, but that can sometimes mean unexpected costs. By raising the limits, we're making usage more predictable and helping users find the right plan for their needs. You can also set a budget to make sure your Upstash databases never exceed a certain cost.

## Increased limits are applied automatically

You don't need to do anything. We will apply the new limits to your Redis DB automatically without downtime.
