Fly.io is a great platform where you can distribute your application globally.
When your application is global, your data needs to be global. You can run
regular [Redis as a Fly.io app](https://fly.io/docs/reference/redis/) but the
problem is it is located in a single region. On the other hand, Upstash Redis
Global Database perfectly fits Fly.io as it is globally replicated. Moreover,
thanks to its [REST based SDK](https://github.com/upstash/upstash-redis), it
does not have any connection problem in stateless runtime.

In this article, I will create a basic Node.js application which accesses
Upstash Redis and deploy it to Fly.io platform.

### Fly.io Setup

- Create a [Fly.io](https://fly.io/) account.
- Install [flyctl](https://fly.io/docs/getting-started/installing-flyctl/) and
  run `flyctl auth login`

### Upstash Redis Setup

- Create a free Global Database
  on [Upstash Console](https://console.upstash.com/)
- Copy the REST_URL and REST_TOKEN, you will use them in the next step.

### Application Code

- Clone the hello world
  app: `git clone https://github.com/fly-apps/hellonode-builtin`
- Install dependencies:
  `npm install express @upstash/redis`
- Update the server.js and replace `url` and `token`:

```js title="server.js"
const express = require("express");
const app = express();
const port = process.env.PORT || 3000;
const { Redis } = require("@upstash/redis");

const redis = new Redis({
  url: "REPLACE_HERE",
  token: "REPLACE_HERE",
});

app.get(["/", "/:name"], async (req, res) => {
  let greeting = "<h1>Hello From Node on Fly!</h1>";
  if (req.url !== "/favicon.ico") {
    const data = await redis.incr("count");
    res.send(greeting + "</br> Counter: " + data);
  } else {
    res.send("");
  }
});

app.listen(port, () => console.log(`HelloNode app listening on port ${port}!`));
```

### Run and Deploy

- Run the application locally:
  `node server.js`
- Launch and deploy to fly.io:
  `flyctl launch`
- You can redeploy your app with `flyctl deploy`

- See your applications url with `flyctl status`
- You can also check your application from fly.io dashboard:
