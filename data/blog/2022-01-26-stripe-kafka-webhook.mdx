In this post, we will show how to push Stripe events to Apache Kafka using the Upstash Webhook API. Once the data is in Kafka, there are many use cases for how you can use it:

- Processing payment events (with Apache Flink or Spark) to notify your business and sales team.
- Triggering processes such as sending Slack messages or emails if a payment fails.
- Using a Kafka connector to move the data to a database or data warehouse to feed reporting and analytics applications.
- Feeding new payment activity data to your CRM.

### Upstash Webhook API

Upstash Kafka has an HTTP-based [Webhook API](/docs/kafka/webhook) which pushes the incoming requests' payload to Kafka. Thanks to the Webhook API, you do not need to write code to move data, and you do not need a separate connector setup.

### Step 1: Kafka Setup

If you donât already have an Upstash account, you can [sign up here](https://console.upstash.com/login). Youâll see the [Upstash console](https://console.upstash.com/) afterward. Select the Kafka tab at the top. Now, you need a Kafka cluster. Click **Create Cluster**:

Create a topic on the second page of the form:

You will see the Kafka Details page:

Scroll down to the Webhook section. You will need the URL in the next step.

### Step 2: Stripe Webhook Setup

Sign in to your Stripe account, then click the [Stripe Webhook](https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks/create) page (Developers > Webhooks). Click the `Add an endpoint` button.

Now, you need to enter the webhook URL copied from the Upstash Console. The URL should have `topic`, `user`, and `pass` parameters. You may want to change the `topic` parameter if you have more than one topic.

You can select which events to be sent. Then click on `Add endpoint`, and you are done.

### Step 3: Testing the Webhook

Now that we have the pipeline, we can test it. Copy the curl command for the Consumer REST API from the Upstash console. Run it in your terminal; it should output an empty message. Then add a new credit card to your Stripe account (or delete one) and run the curl command again. You should see the Stripe event saved to the Kafka topic.

```shell
curl https://full-mantis-14289-us1-rest-kafka.upstash.io/consume/GROUP_NAME/GROUP_INSTANCE_NAME/stripe-events -u \

  } ]
```

### Conclusion

In this post, we managed to integrate Stripe with Upstash Kafka without writing code or running a connector. This is possible for all services that have webhook support to notify external services.
