In this post, we will show how to block the traffic to your web app from a country. You can apply the same logic to manage traffic with other filters (IP address, user-agent etc). We aim a decoupled, lightweight and dynamic solution:

- I should not need to update and deploy code to update country.
- It should have minimum overhead and cost on my application.

We will use [Vercel Edge Middleware](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/functions/edge-middleware) and [Upstash Edge Flags](/docs/redis/sdks/edge-flags/overview).

### Vercel Edge Middleware

Vercel Edge middleware is a code that intercepts the web requests before being processed by backend. We will use it to check the country and user agent because:

- It is fast and cheap.
- Decoupled from your application.

### Upstash Edge Flags

Indeed you can check country and block traffic with a simple if statement in your edge middleware code as below:

```jsx
const BLOCKED_COUNTRY = "BAD_COUNTRY";

export function middleware(req: NextRequest) {
  const country = req.geo.country;

  if (country === BLOCKED_COUNTRY) {
    return new Response("Blocked ", { status: 451 });
  }
  return new Response(`Greetings`);
}
```

So why do we need edge flags? Edge flags will enable us to manage the rules without updating the code.

Letâ€™s start..

### Step 1: Redis and Edge Flags Setup

Create a Redis database on [Upstash Console](https://console.upstash.com/redis?new=true). For best performance, select global and the regions that users likely to be.

Go to [Edge flags page](https://console.upstash.com/edge-flags) and select the database you have just created. Create a new flag with a name `blockTraffic`. Then add a rule for blocked countries:
`Country` `is in array` `United States` -> `on`

Save and enable the flag.

The above flag will be enabled if the request is originating from the United States.

### Step 2: Next.js Project Setup

Create a Next.js application.

```shell
npx create-next-app@latest --typescript
```

Install @upstash packages:

```shell
$ npm install @upstash/edge-flags @upstash/redis
```

Create middleware.ts (top level in your project folder):

```ts title="/middleware.ts"
import { NextRequest, NextResponse } from "next/server";

import { Client as EdgeFlags } from "@upstash/edge-flags";
import { Redis } from "@upstash/redis";

const edgeFlags = new EdgeFlags({ redis: Redis.fromEnv() });
export default async function middleware(
  req: NextRequest,
): Promise<NextResponse> {
  const enabled = await edgeFlags.getFlag("blockTraffic", req.geo ?? {});

  if (!enabled) {
    const url = new URL(req.url);
    url.pathname = "/blocked";
    return NextResponse.rewrite(url);
  }

  return NextResponse.next();
}

export const config = {
  matcher: "/",
};
```

Let's create a page for the blocked:

```tsx title="pages/blocked.tsx"
import styles from "@/styles/Home.module.css";

export default function Blocked() {
  return (
    <div>
      <main className={styles.main}>
        <h3>Access blocked.</h3>
      </main>
    </div>
  );
}
```

That's all! Now you can deploy the app to Vercel:
`vercel deploy`

Make sure to add the environment variables to Vercel either by copying them from the [Upstash console](https://console.upstash.com/redis) or by using the [Upstash integration](https://vercel.com/integrations/upstash).

Visit the page, you should be redirected to the blocked page if you are in US. Test different countries using VPN.

<Note title="Geolocation in development">
  Geolocation data is not avallable locally. You have to deploy to Vercel to
  test it the app.
