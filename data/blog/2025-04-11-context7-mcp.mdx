Last month, we introduced [Context7](/blog/context7-llmtxt-cursor) - a way to stop Cursor, Claude or any LLM from generating broken, outdated code.

The idea: feed your LLM the latest documentation for the libraries you're using — so it doesn't rely on old training data.

Today, we're launching our biggest update yet: The **Context7 MCP** - a direct integration with Cursor, Windsurf, or any LLM client that supports the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol).

---

### Why Context7 Exists

LLMs rely on outdated training data. When you're using newer versions of libraries or frameworks, they often hallucinate:

- ❌ **Broken code** from outdated versions
- ❌ **Made-up APIs** that never existed
- ❌ **Vague answers** that aren't helpful

For fast-moving libraries or frameworks like Next.js, Zod, Tailwind, or React Query, using LLMs by themselves doesn't work well.

### Introducing: The Context7 MCP

In the first version of Context7, you had to copy a link from our site and paste it into your prompt. Now, just say “use context7” in Cursor — and you're done.

Examples:
- "How does the new Next.js `after()` function work? use context7"
- "How do I invalidate a query in React Query? use context7"
- "Protect this route with NextAuth, use context7"

We fetch the latest docs and code examples straight from the official documentation and inject them into the model's context.

Just:

- 1️⃣ Write your prompt normally
- 2️⃣ Tell the LLM to use context7
- 3️⃣ Get working code in official-documentation quality

---

### How It Works: Model Context Protocol (MCP)

The Context7 MCP uses the Model Context Protocol, [Anthropic's Model Context Protocol](https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol), an open standard that lets LLMs talk to external tools like Context7. 

When you add “use context7” (or something similar, like "get the docs using context7") to a prompt, we:

1. Detect the library or framework you're asking about
2. Pull the latest documentation & code examples
3. Filter the documentation by topic (e.g. “routing”, “validation”, “middleware”)
4. Inject it straight into the LLM's input

### Getting Started

#### Requirements

- Node.js >= v18.0.0
- Cursor, Windsurf, Claude Desktop, or another MCP Client

#### Install in Cursor

Go to: `Settings` -> `Cursor Settings` -> `MCP` -> `Add new global MCP server`

Or paste this into your Cursor `~/.cursor/mcp.json` file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "context7": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@upstash/context7-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

#### Install in Windsurf

Add this to your Windsurf MCP config file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "context7": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@upstash/context7-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```
