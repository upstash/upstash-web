In this blog post, we'll explore the implementation of an upgradable read-write lock in Go, 
We will talk about why we needed it by giving concrete examples from the real-world use case and also discuss potential pitfalls during the blog post.

## Why do we need an upgradable read-write lock?

In go, even though the guideline says to avoid locks when building a Redis® server that should be concurrently accessed by multiple connections, 
we usually had to fall back to locks in order to get maximum performance. And, this time standard go library wasn't enough.

In the Upstash Redis® server, we are guarding the keys of the Redis® with locks. When searching for how we can scale it, there were a couple of 
ideas. One is partitioning the locks, and the other is replacing the `sync.Mutex` with a sync.RWMutex. Partitioning locks could be a blog for another 
day, we will focus on RWMutex for this blog post.

sync.RWMutex is the read-write lock in go. It allows multiple readers to have the lock at the same time when there is no writer around.
It allows the single writer to have the lock ensuring that there are no readers in the critical section.

Since all of our commands work in memory, they are pretty quick and don't keep long under the lock. But there are commands that have a tendency to take long. These commands are usually the ones that their complexity depends on how large the data is like [SUNION](https://redis.io/commands/sunion/),[SDIFF](https://redis.io/commands/sdiff/), [ZDIFF](https://redis.io/commands/zdiff/) etc. 

Since they are read operations, it is `mostly` ok. It means that other readers can still continue under RWMutex. The writers will be blocked.
We realized another problem. All of these commands have `STORE` versions like [SUNIONSTORE](https://redis.io/commands/zunionstore/),  [SDIFFSTORE](https://redis.io/commands/sdiffstore/), [ZDIFFSTORE](https://redis.io/commands/zdiffstore/), etc. They need to get the write lock.
And if that takes long both reads and writes need to wait. The solution comes after realizing that the part taking long is the reading and preparing of the result and not the `STORE`

## First naive wrong attempt

Let’s assume that we are doing this for `SUNIONSTORE`. We may try to `unlock` for the reader first, then `lock` for the write access as follows:

```go
mutex := sync.RWMutex()

mutex.RLock()
//Calculate the UNION of two sets under read lock but don't assign it anywhere
mutex.RUnlock()

mutex.Lock()
//Assign it to the in-memory store
mutex.Unlock()
```

This does not work because the `SUNIONSTORE` is not atomic anymore. Once we release the read lock another operation can get in and modify the 
set. After that, this code will try to store a stale set in the memory, overriding the change made in between.

## Second naive wrong attempt

Ok, if releasing the read-lock is a problem. Let’s not release it and take the write lock instead as follows:

```go
mutex := sync.RWMutex()

mutex.RLock()
//Calculate UNION of two sets under read lock but don't assign it anywhere

//Upgrade to the write lock without giving up the read lock
mutex.Lock()

//Assign it to the in-memory store
mutex.Unlock()


mutex.RUnlock()
```

If you do this the code will hang at `mutex.Lock`. You can't get a write-lock as long as readers are holding the read lock. 

## Correct solution

What we need is an upgradeable read-write lock. There can be various different APIs. I will first show what we ended up with.

```go

mutex.UpgradableRLock()
//Calculate the UNION of two sets under read lock but don't assign it anywhere

//Upgrade to the write lock without giving up the read lock
mutex.UpgradeWLock()
//Assign it to the in-memory store

mutex.UpgradableRUnlock()
```

We need to mention at this point that this idea is well-known in the literature and there are implementations of upgrading a readlock even
in the standard libraries of other languages. Examples:
[JAVA StampedLock](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/locks/StampedLock.html)
[.NET ReaderWriterLockSlim](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.threading.readerwriterlockslim?view=net-7.0)

Our API is very close to the `.NET ReaderWriterLockSlim`. At this point, you might say that this usage looks very similar to the second attempt.
How can it get away with deadlock? The trick is that it has one more mode `upgradeble-read` together with `read` and `write`. Semantics are 
as follows:

- Both `read` and `upgradable-read` locks can be held together at the same time.
- `write-lock` prevents both `read` and `upgradable-read` from entering the critical section.
- There can be multiple goroutines holding the `read` lock but there can be only a single `upgradable-read`.

The last point is important. If we don't have that guarantee, we will again end up with a deadlock. If we allow let’s say two `upgradable-read` to be acquired when they come to `upgrade to write`, one of them has to give up the `read-lock`. Therefore, the atomicity will be broken again.

## The implementation

To tell you the truth, we ended up with the API after realizing that it is trivial to modify [GO sync.RWMutex](https://pkg.go.dev/sync#RWMutex) into 
this API.

```go

mutex.UpgradableRLock()
//Calculate the UNION of two sets under read lock but don't assign it anywhere

//Upgrade to the write lock without giving up the read lock
mutex.UpgradeWLock()
//Assign it to the in-memory store

mutex.UpgradableRUnlock()
```

To understand our implementation, we need to take a look [sync.RWMutex](https://pkg.go.dev/sync#RWMutex) especially `Lock` and `Rlock`

```go

type RWMutex struct {
	w           Mutex        // held if there are pending writers
	// .... skipped
}

func (rw *RWMutex) Lock() {
	// First, resolve competition with other writers.
	rw.w.Lock()
	// Announce to readers that there is a pending writer.
	r := rw.readerCount.Add(-rwmutexMaxReaders) + rwmutexMaxReaders
	// Wait for active readers.
	if r != 0 && rw.readerWait.Add(r) != 0 {
		semaphoreAcquire(&rw.writerSem)
	}
}

func (rw *RWMutex) RLock() {
	if rw.readerCount.Add(1) < 0 {
		// A writer is pending, wait for it.
		semaphoreAcquire(&rw.readerSem)
	}
}
```

The `RLock` is really simple. It just increments a reader count and sleep for a writer to leave the critical section if necessary.

The `Lock` gets the underlying `w` lock first. At this point, no other writes can get in, but it has nothing to do with reads yet.
Then it announces to the readers that they can not get in anymore. That means if we just split that method into two, the first half is basically
an `UpgradebleRLock` and the second part is `UpgradeWLock`. In other words, the second part upgrades the `upgradable-read` to `write`. 

This gives us everything we need already and all we did is to separate a method into two.

```go 

func (rw *UpgradableRWMutex) UpgradableRLock() {
	// First, resolve competition with other writers.
	// Disallow writers to acquire the lock
	rw.w.Lock()	
}

func (rw *UpgradableRWMutex) UpgradeWLock() {
	// Announce to readers there is a pending writer.
	r := rw.readerCount.Add(-rwmutexMaxReaders) + rwmutexMaxReaders
	// Wait for active readers.
	if r != 0 && rw.readerWait.Add(r) != 0 {
		semaphoreAcquire(&rw.writerSem)
	}
}

```

We still need to figure out how to unlock though, a.k.a `UpgradableRUnlock`. 
This method should call the `sync.RWMutex.Unlock()` if it is upgraded to the `write`.
It should call just the `rw.w.Unlock()` if it is not upgraded. Because all we did was just `rw.w.Lock()` anyway so far.

We will add a `bool` to keep track if the lock is upgraded or not. And we don't need to guard this `bool` for concurrent
access because we will access it only under `rw.w.Lock()`

```go 

type UpgradableRWMutex struct {
	//... skipped. It’s the same as sync.RWMutex

	// Keep track if an upgradeable read-lock is upgraded to a write-lock or not. Always accessed under w locked
	upgraded           bool

}

func (rw *UpgradableRWMutex) UpgradableRLock() {
	// First, resolve competition with other writers.
	// Disallow writers to acquire the lock
	rw.w.Lock()	
}

func (rw *UpgradableRWMutex) UpgradeWLock() {
	rw.upgraded = true
	// Announce to readers there is a pending writer.
	r := rw.readerCount.Add(-rwmutexMaxReaders) + rwmutexMaxReaders
	// Wait for active readers.
	if r != 0 && rw.readerWait.Add(r) != 0 {
		semaphoreAcquire(&rw.writerSem)
	}
}

func (rw *UpgradableRWMutex) UpgradableRUnlock() {
	rw.upgradableReadMode = false
	if rw.upgraded {
		rw.upgraded = false
		rw.Unlock()
	} else {
		rw.w.Unlock()
	}
}
```
