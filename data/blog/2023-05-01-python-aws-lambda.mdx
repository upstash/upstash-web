In this blog post, I will guide you through building a serverless URL shortener service built on Upstash Redis, AWS Lambda (Python), and AWS API Gateway. The main purpose of this blog post is to demonstrate the process of creating a Python Lambda function, connecting it to Redis, and consuming it via an API.

You may reach an implementation of the project via: [URL Shortener](https://url-shortener-kappa-jet.vercel.app/)

![app](/blog/python-lambda/app-bg.png)

**NOTE**: The output URLs are for demonstration purposes; an active URL shortener would have a shorter and simpler domain address, so our focus here is on the functionality.

### Project Description

The project consists of one database on Upstash Redis, two Python Lambda functions, and an API Gateway on AWS. Users may use either the web interface or the API to consume the shortener service.

The `shortener` Lambda function creates a shortened URL key from a long URL provided in an HTTP request query. It then stores the short URL key and its corresponding long URL value in Upstash Redis, before returning the short URL to the user.

The `redirector` Lambda function redirects users from a short URL to its corresponding long URL. It retrieves the long URL from Redis using the short URL key and sends an HTTP 302 redirection response to the user’s browser. This function helps users access the desired content without the need to recall or manually enter the long URL.

Finally, we'll create an API Gateway to consume the Lambda functions. This API will be connected to our basic URL shortener frontend.

### Setting up the Upstash Redis

We can create our Redis Database on [Upstash Console](https://console.upstash.com/). After logging in, click the _Create Database_ button. It'll take a few seconds, and you are all set up. Then, copy and paste the `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_HOST`, `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_PORT` and `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_PASSWORD` variables from _Details_ section to a file. We are going to use these keys in the AWS environment variables.

### Creating the Serverless Functions on AWS Lambda

Next up, we will create our serverless Python functions. After logging in to AWS, direct to [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/). From the Dashboard, create the lambda function.

![function creation](/blog/python-lambda/function-creation-bg.png)

### Lambda Function for URL Shortening

The first thing to do is add the environment variables. From the `shortener` function overview, go to **Configuration > Environment variables > Edit > Add environment variable**. Then, type in the `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_HOST`, `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_PORT` and `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_PASSWORD` as the keys, and their corresponding values from Upstash Console.

Now we can start coding. Return back to the **Code** section of `shortener` function, and paste the code below. This will provide us the connection to Upstash Redis Database.

```python
import random
import string
import json
import redis

#Create a redis client.
redis_client = redis.Redis(
  host= UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_HOST,
  port= UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_PORT,
  password= UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_PASSWORD
)
```

Then we will implement our main shortener algorithm. What the code snippet below does is:

- getting the query parameter `long_url` from the API Request URL,
- generating a random 7 character key for the shortened URL,
- setting the value of this key on Upstash Redis to the long URL,
- returning an HTTP 200 Response with our full short URL in the body of the response.

Just below the Redis client creation, add the `generate_short_url` and `lambda_handler` functions.

```python
def generate_short_url():
	# Define the character set for generating the short URLs
    CHARSET = string.ascii_letters + string.digits

    # Generate a random short URL using the character set
    short_url = ''.join(random.choice(CHARSET) for _ in range(7))

    # Check if the short URL already exists in Redis
    if redis_client.exists(short_url):
        # If it does, recursively generate a new short URL
        return generate_short_url()

    # Otherwise, return the new short URL
    return short_url


def lambda_handler(event, context):
    long_url = event["queryStringParameters"]['long_url']

    base_url = f"https://{event['headers']['Host'] }/{event['requestContext']['stage']}/"

    # Generate a unique short URL
    short_url_key = generate_short_url()

    # Store the mapping between the short URL and long URL in Redis
    redis_client.set(short_url_key, long_url)

    # Return the short URL to the client
    response_body = {
        'short_url' :  base_url + short_url_key,
    }

    response={
        'statusCode' : 200,
        'headers' : {'ContentType':'application/json',
                    "Access-Control-Allow-Origin": "*"},
        'body' : json.dumps(response_body)
    }

    return response
```

Then click **Deploy**.
Even though the codes are ready; if you [test the lambda](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/testing-functions.html) now, you will get the response below from Lambda

`Unable to import module 'lambda_function': No module named 'redis'`

That is because, in order to use the external Python libraries, we need to create our own libraries as a custom package and then find a way to attach the package to Lambda. There are several ways to resolve this, but my go-to solution would be using Lambda Layers. Don't let that confuse you, it's rather a simple process.

### Creating the Layer

First up, we have to create and zip the package. Go to your local terminal and type in the commands below. That will create a `requirements-package.zip` file in the packages folder with Redis installed.

```shell
mkdir packages
cd packages
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

mkdir python
cd python
pip install redis -t .

rm -rf *dist-info
cd..
zip -r requirements-package.zip python
```

Then, go back to the `shortener` function on AWS and direct to Layers from the sidebar. Click on the **Create layer** and fill in the needed configuration and upload the `requirements-package.zip` file, just similar to mine.

![creating layers](/blog/python-lambda/layer-creation-bg.png)

When the layer is created, we need to connect this layer to our `shortener` function. Go to the Layers section of the function and click **Add a layer** button.

![adding layers](/blog/python-lambda/layer-adding-bg.png)

Now, we should be able to shorten the URLs. What remains is retrieving the long URL from the `short_url` key and redirecting the browser to that URL. For that, we are going to create a `redirector` lambda function.

### Lambda Function for URL Redirection

The process of creating `redirector` lambda is the same as described above. Here are the steps once again:

- Creating a lambda function named `redirector` from the Lambda dashboard.
- Setting the environment variables.
- Typing in the code given just below.
- Creating a layer with the `requirements-package.zip` file. (We may use the `redis-library-layer` again, requirements are the same in this case.)
- Adding the layer to the lambda function.

Here's the main algorithm for the redirector lambda.

```python
import json
import redis

#Create a redis client.
redis_client = redis.Redis(
  host= UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_HOST,
  port= UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_PORT,
  password= UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_PASSWORD
)

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    # Get the short URL from the request path
    short_url = event['pathParameters']['short_url']

    # Look up the long URL associated with the short URL in Redis
    long_url = redis_client.get(short_url).decode('utf-8').strip('"')

    long_url = format_url_for_redirection(long_url)

    # If the short URL doesn't exist, return a 404 error
    if not long_url:
        response = {
            'statusCode': 404,
            'body': json.dumps({'error': 'Short URL not found'})
        }
        return response

    # Otherwise, redirect the user to the long URL
    response = {
        'statusCode': 302,
        'headers' : {'Location':long_url},
        'body' : ''
    }
    return response


def format_url_for_redirection(url):
    if not url.startswith("http://") and not url.startswith("https://"):
        url = "https://" + url
    return url
```

Just like that, our lambdas are all ready! Although this is functional, to make this URL shortener an accessible service, we have to find a way to run our lambdas. There are several ways to consume lambda functions, but for this implementation we'll use the **AWS API Gateway**.

### Creating the API Gateway on AWS

First, head to API Gateway from the AWS Console. In the dashboard, click the **Create API** button and build a **REST API**. After doing the basic configuration, we have our API in seconds.

![creating the api](/blog/python-lambda/api-creation-bg.png)

We then need to connect the API Gateway to our Lambda functions. In the resources section, go to **Actions > Create Resource**. Enter the `resource name` and `resource path`.

![shortener](/blog/python-lambda/shortener-bg.png)

Then click on the `/shortener` path in the **Resources** and head to **Actions > Create Method > Select GET > Confirm**. This part is pretty important, this configuration enables us to transfer the request data from the API Gateway to the Lambda functions. Make sure they're correct!

![creating resource](/blog/python-lambda/resource-creation-bg.png)

We have connected the shortener function to our API, so we can now shorten our URLs. However, we need the `redirector` Lambda function connected to the API for our service to work. Click on the `/` in the **Resources**, head to **Actions > Create Resource**.

![short url](/blog/python-lambda/short-url-bg.png)

Click on the `/{short_url}` in the **Resources** section, then **Actions > Create Method > Choose GET > Confirm**.

![short url resource](/blog/python-lambda/short-url-resource-bg.png)

Finally, our API is set up. The final step is deploying the API. Go to **Actions > Deploy API > Create New Stage**. Type in the necessary fields and deploy. We now have a public API. In the **Stages** section, you can see the public Invoke URL for your API.

There is a final task to do: triggering the Lambda Functions via the `serverless-shortener-API` gateway.

Go to the `shortener` Lambda function, within the **Function overview** section, click the **Add Trigger** button.

![creating trigger](/blog/python-lambda/trigger-creation-bg.png)

When you add the trigger to both of the functions, our public API and the Lambda functions are ready to consume. For the `shortener` function, triggering URL path is as such:

`<YOUR_INVOKE_URL>/shortener?short_url="<LONG_URL>"`

To trigger the `redirector` function, you'll need the response from the `shortener` function. The triggering URL for the `redirector` has the structure below:

`<YOUR_INVOKE_URL>/<SHORT_URL_KEY>`

When you click it or send an HTTP Request to it, you'll be redirected to your long URL.
Actually, our service is ready, but we'll create a web interface as a bit of sparkle.

### Creating the Web Interface and Handling Function Usage

We'll use HTML, Bootstrap and JavaScript for the frontend. When the user types in a URL and click the **Shorten** button, a url will be prompted, redirecting the user to the original website.

![app](/blog/python-lambda/app-bg.png)

This is a rather simple website with a few elements. First, add the following line to the `<head>` block of the HTML code in order to use the Bootstrap features.

`<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.0.0/css/bootstrap.min.css"/>`

Within the `<body>` block, we'll have the main HTML elements.

```html
<div class="container mt-5">
  <h1 class="mb-4 text-center">URL Shortener</h1>
  <div class="row justify-content-center">
    <div class="col-md-6">
      <div class="input-group mb-3">
        <input
          type="text"
          class="form-control"
          id="url-input"
          placeholder="Enter URL to shorten"
        />
        <div class="input-group-append">
          <button class="btn btn-primary" type="button" id="shorten-btn">
            Shorten
          </button>
        </div>
      </div>
      <a id="short-url" class="d-none"></a>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

After adding the elements, only the data fetching from the API Gateway remains. We'll handle that with JavaScript. Before the end of the `<body>` part, insert the URL fetching functionality. Don’t forget to replace `<INVOKE_URL>` with the one from your AWS API Gateway.

```html
<!-- Add Bootstrap JS -->
<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.2.1.slim.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/popper.js/1.12.9/umd/popper.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.0.0/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script>

<!-- Add custom JS -->
<script>
  const shortenBtn = document.getElementById("shorten-btn");
  const urlInput = document.getElementById("url-input");
  const urlOutput = document.getElementById("short-url");

  shortenBtn.addEventListener("click", async function () {
    let long_url = urlInput.value;
    const apiUrl = `<INVOKE_URL>/shortener?long_url="${long_url}"`;
    const response = await fetch(apiUrl);
    const data = await response.json();
    shortUrl = data.short_url;

    urlOutput.innerHTML = shortUrl;
    urlOutput.href = shortUrl;
    urlOutput.classList.remove("d-none");
  });
</script>
```

### Final Words and Project Improvements

We've implemented the main features for our serverless URL shortener project. I hope it has been a clear demonstration of creating Python Lambda functions and consuming them. I'll also have some suggestions for improving the project, if you'd like to keep working on this project.

- [Setting a custom domain](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/how-to-custom-domains.html) for the URL shortener. The `Invoke URL` given by AWS is rather complex. Since this project's main purpose was demonstrating AWS Lambda and Upstash Redis, I didn't want to make this post longer with it. But If you'd like you could change the URL to a simpler and shorter one from the AWS API Gateway.
- Implementing Upstash Rate Limit for the API. I have used free tier services for this project, but if you intend to build an active and public service, you should consider setting up a request limit to avoid unexpected costs.
- Hosting this project on Vercel.

Thanks for reading.
