Today we are releasing `v1.0.0` version of the `upstash-redis` python package. It is now available on [GitHub](https://github.com/upstash/redis-python) and [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/upstash-redis/).

The package is a connectionless HTTP-based client for upstash redis,
designed to be usable in serverless environments like aws lambda,
google cloud functions or any environment where HTTP is preferred over TCP.

## What's new?

With the new versions the package comes with python docstrings for every command with example usages in them.

You can also find the documentation and examples for every command in the [upstash redis python docs](https://upstash.com/docs/oss/sdks/py/redis/commands/overview).

## Quick Start

Install the package

```shell
pip install upstash-redis
```

Create a redis client

```python
from upstash_redis import UpstashRedis

redis = Redis(url="UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL", token="UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN")

redis.set("key", "value")
```

You can also use the environment variables `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL` and `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN` instead of passing them to the constructor.

```python
from upstash_redis import UpstashRedis

redis = Redis.from_env()

redis.set("key", "value")
```

The sdk also supports async functions with `asyncio` and `aiohttp` packages.

```python
import asyncio
from upstash_redis.asyncio import Redis

async def main():
    redis = Redis.from_env()

    await redis.set("key", "value")

asyncio.run(main())
```

If you are in a serverless environment that allows it, it's recommended to initialise the client outside the request handler to be reused while your function is still hot.

### Value type change in some commands

Some commands like `set` or `hset` accepted `Any` as a value type. The value was then converted to a string using `json.dumps`. This leaded to some confusion in some commands.

This is now change to a new type, `ValueT` that only accepts `str`, `int`, `float` and `bool`.

```python
ValueT = Union[str, int, float, bool]

def set(
    self,
    key: str,
    value: ValueT,
    ...
) -> Optional[str]: ...
```

The sdk still supports the old behaviour but the typing is changed.

```python
# Works, but gives a type error
redis.set("key", {"foo": "bar"})

# Works
redis.set("key", json.dumps({"foo": "bar"}))
```

### Geo commands returning GeoSearchResult instead of Dict

The `geosearch` and `georadius` commands now return a `GeoSearchResult` object instead of a dictionary which is more convenient to use.

### Set commands returning List instead of Set

Changed return types of `sdiff`, `sunion`, `sinter`, and `smembers` method to `List` from `Set`.
This eliminates extra set allocation for users doing iteration over the result. If they want, they can return the list into set themselves.

## Conclusion

We hope you enjoy the new version of the package. We are planning on adding pipeline and json commands support to the python sdk in the future.
