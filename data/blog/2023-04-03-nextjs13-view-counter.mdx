Inspired by [Lee's blog](https://leerob.io/blog), where every blog post is
showing the number of views it has, I wanted to do something similar for my
page. I'm also using Next.js 13 with the new app router but instead of storing
the page views in a mysql database, I'll be using Upstash Redis.

Here's an example of what we'll be building.
Each card on the home page will show the number of views it has.

## Why Redis?

Redis already comes with 2 great commands that make it trivial to deduplicate
and to increment a counter.

In order to get a more accurate counter, I want to debounce the incrementing of
the counter. If a user refreshes the page, the counter should only be
incremented once. We can do this really easily with Redis' `SET` command. It has
a `NX` option that will only set the key if it doesn't exist yet and an `EX`
option that will expire the key after a given amount of seconds. By combining
both of these options we can ensure a single user does not increment the counter
multiple times within a given timeframe.

The second command is `INCR` which will increment a given key by 1 atomically.

## Setting up Redis

Setting up a database on Upstash is easy and includes 10k requests per day
for free! You can create a new database
[here](https://console.upstash.com?new=true). It literally takes only a few
seconds. Afterwards scroll down and copy the `REST` connection
secrets to your `.env.local` file:

```bash title=".env.local"
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL=
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN=
```

## Next.js

Now that we have a Redis database, we can start implementing the counter. We need to install @upstash/redis first:

```bash
pnpm add @upstash/redis
```

In order to store the page views, we need two components. An api route and a
client component. Let's start with the api route.

## /api/incr.ts

Upstash and `@upstash/redis` is compatible with Vercel's edge functions, so
first of all, we will import everything we need, setup redis and configure the
runtime to be `edge`.

Create a new file `/api/incr.ts` and add the following code:

```ts title="/api/incr.ts" {1,7}
import { Redis } from "@upstash/redis";
import { NextRequest, NextResponse } from "next/server";

const redis = Redis.fromEnv();

export const config = {
  runtime: "edge",
};
```

Next up we'll require a slug or similar identifier to be passed in the request
body. If it's not present, we'll return a `400` status code.

```ts title="/api/incr.ts" {2,5}
export default async function incr(req: NextRequest): Promise<NextResponse> {
  const body = await req.json();
  const slug = body.slug as string | undefined;
  if (!slug) {
    return new NextResponse("Slug not found", { status: 400 });
  }

  // more to come here
}
```

Then we also need to get the user's IP address. We can do this by using the
`req.ip` property. We'll hash the IP address using the `SHA-256` algorithm and
store it in the database. This way we don't have to store the IP address
directly, which could be a security concern.

```ts title="/api/incr.ts"
const ip = req.ip;
// Hash the IP and turn it into a hex string
const buf = await crypto.subtle.digest("SHA-256", new TextEncoder().encode(ip));
const hash = Array.from(new Uint8Array(buf))
  .map((b) => b.toString(16).padStart(2, "0"))
  .join("");
```

Now let's use the first redis command mentioned above. Using `SET` together with
`NX` and `EX` gives us an easy way to check if a specific ip address has been
viewing a page within the last 24 hours:

```ts title="/api/incr.ts" {4,5}
const isNew = await redis.set(["deduplicate", hash, slug].join(":"), true, {
  nx: true,
  ex: 24 * 60 * 60,
});
if (!isNew) {
  new NextResponse(null, { status: 202 });
}
```

The last thing to do is to increment the counter for the given slug. We'll use
the `INCR` command for this:

```ts title="/api/incr.ts" {2}
await redis.incr(["pageviews", "projects", slug].join(":"));
return new NextResponse(null, { status: 202 });
```

For reference, you can find the complete code
[here](https://github.com/chronark/chronark.com/blob/main/pages/api/incr.ts)

## /app/[slug]/view.tsx

Next, let's create a small client component, that sends a request to the api route we just created whenever it mounts. This component can then be embedded in any page we want to track.

```tsx title="/app/[slug]/view.tsx"
"use client";

import { useEffect } from "react";

export const ReportView: React.FC<{ slug: string }> = ({ slug }) => {
  useEffect(() => {
    fetch("/api/incr", {
      method: "POST",
      headers: {
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({ slug }),
    });
  }, [slug]);

  return null;
};
```

## /app/[slug]/page.tsx

The last thing we need to do is to add the `ReportView` component to the page we want to track:

```tsx title="/app/[slug]/page.tsx"
import { ReportView } from "./view";

type Props = {
  params: {
    slug: string;
  };
};

export default function Page({ params }: Props) {
  return (
    <div>
      <ReportView slug={params.slug} />
      {/* Add your page content here */}
    </div>
  );
}
```

From now on all visits to `/app/[slug]` will be tracked and the counter will be incremented for each unique visitor in the last 24h.

## Displaying Views

Tracking the views is nice, but we also want to display them publicly. Let's see how we can do that.

In order to display the number of views, we need to look them up from the database. We can do this by using the `GET` command. We should also add a `revalidate` config to the page component, so that the page is revalidated every 60 seconds and not for every request.

```tsx title="/app/[slug]/page.tsx"
type Props = {
	params: {
		slug: string;
	};
};

export const revalidate = 60

export default function Page({ params }: Props) {
  const views = await redis.get<number>(["pageviews", "projects", params.slug].join(":")) ?? 0

  return ...
}
```
