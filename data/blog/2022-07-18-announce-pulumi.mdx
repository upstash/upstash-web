## Announcing Upstash Pulumi Provider
After community requests, we have developed Pulumi Provider for our resources, which are publicly available.

[Pulumi](https://www.pulumi.com) is an automated provisioning tool similar to Terraform but it leverages the functionalities of modern programming languages such as TypeScript, Go and Python.
This way, you can create conditional resources, multiple resources via loops and so on, enabling for more dynamic and maintainable IAC.

### What's New
Other than our fully new Pulumi Provider, we have created `Kafka Credential` resource for both of our Terraform and Pulumi providers.

### Creating your infrastructure as code with your favorite languages
#### Create pulumi template: `pulumi new <your_language>`

#### TypeScript / JavaScript
```shell
const createdDb = new upstash.RedisDatabase("mydb", {
    databaseName: "pulumi-ts-db",
    region: "eu-west-1",
    tls: true
})
```

#### Go
```shell
createdCluster, _ := upstash.NewKafkaCluster(ctx, "exampleCluster", &upstash.KafkaClusterArgs{
    ClusterName: pulumi.String("pulumi-go-cluster"),
    Multizone:   pulumi.Bool(false),
    Region:      pulumi.String("eu-west-1"),
})
```

#### Python
```shell
created_team = upstash.Team(
    resource_name="myTeam",
    team_name="pulumi team",
    copy_cc=True,
    team_members={
        "<owner_email>": "owner",
        "<second_email>": "admin"
    }
)

```

#### Create / Update resources: `pulumi up`

### Future Work
We plan to keep the developer experince easy and intuitive.
