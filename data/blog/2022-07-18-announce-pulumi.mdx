## Announcing Upstash Pulumi Provider
After community requests, we have developed Pulumi Provider for our resources, which is now publicly available.

[Pulumi](https://www.pulumi.com) is an automated provisioning tool similar to Terraform but it leverages the functionalities of modern programming languages such as TypeScript, Go and Python.
This way, you can create conditional resources, multiple resources via loops and so on, enabling for more dynamic and maintainable IAC.
### Creating your infrastructure as code with your favorite languages
#### Create pulumi template: `pulumi new <your_language>`

#### TypeScript / JavaScript
```shell
const createdDb = new upstash.RedisDatabase("mydb", {
    databaseName: "pulumi-ts-db",
    region: "eu-west-1",
    tls: true
})
```

#### Go
```shell
createdCluster, _ := upstash.NewKafkaCluster(ctx, "exampleCluster", &upstash.KafkaClusterArgs{
    ClusterName: pulumi.String("pulumi-go-cluster"),
    Multizone:   pulumi.Bool(false),
    Region:      pulumi.String("eu-west-1"),
})
```

#### Python
```shell
created_team = upstash.Team(
    resource_name="myTeam",
    team_name="pulumi team",
    copy_cc=True,
    team_members={
        "<owner_email>": "owner",
        "<second_email>": "admin"
    }
)

```

#### CRUD your resources: `pulumi up`

### Future Work
We want to keep the developer experince easy and intuitive. Hence, we will be keeping our tools up-to-date with our services. 
As an example, Qstash resources will soon be added
to both of our Terraform and Pulumi providers.

### Closing Words
For resource creations with different languages, you can have a look at [our repo](https://github.com/upstash/upstash-pulumi-provider/tree/master/examples).

You can give your feedbacks on any of our services via [twitter](https://twitter.com/upstash) or [discord](https://discord.gg/w9SenAtbme), which will be greatly appreciated.
