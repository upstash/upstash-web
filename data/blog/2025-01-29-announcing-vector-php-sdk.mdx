On January 31st, 2024, [we announced the public release of Upstash Vector](/blog/introducing-vector-database), our serverless vector database.
Upstash Vector allows you to store and query vector data, enabling you to build applications such as semantic search, recommendation engines, RAG, and more.

Today, we are excited to announce the official PHP SDKs for Upstash Vector.
These SDKs make it easy to integrate Upstash Vector into your applications, whether you're building a web app, CLI tool, or library.

### Upstash Vector for PHP

The Vector SDK for PHP is our core SDK, enabling seamless integration with Upstash Vector from any PHP project or framework.

Installing our SDK is easy with Composer:

```bash
composer require upstash/vector
```

Using our SDK should feel familiar if you’ve worked with our other SDKs, such as JavaScript, Python, or Go.

```php
use Upstash\Vector\Index;
use Upstash\Vector\VectorUpsert;
use Upstash\Vector\VectorQuery;

$index = new Index(
  url: 'UPSTASH_VECTOR_REST_URL',
  token: 'UPSTASH_VECTOR_REST_TOKEN',
);

$index->upsertMany([
  new VectorUpsert(
    id: 'id-1',
    vector: [0.1, 0.2],
    metadata: ['metadata_field' => 'metadata_value1']
  ),
  new VectorUpsert(
    id: 'id-2',
    vector: [0.3, 0.4],
    metadata: ['metadata_field' => 'metadata_value2']
  ),
]);

$results = $index->query(new VectorQuery(vector: [ 0.6, 0.9 ], topK: 10));

// ...
```

We've also prepared a quick start guide for the PHP SDK, available [here](https://docs.upstash.com/reference/vector-php-sdk).

### Upstash Vector for Laravel

Building on the Vector SDK for PHP, we’ve created a Laravel-specific SDK that simplifies integrating Upstash Vector into your Laravel application.

You can install the SDK for Laravel using Composer:

```bash
composer require upstash/vector-laravel
```

Our Laravel SDK is automatically configured, and the only step required is adding the Upstash Vector environment variables to your `.env` file.

```dotenv
UPSTASH_VECTOR_REST_URL=
UPSTASH_VECTOR_REST_TOKEN=
```

Once you’ve set up the environment variables, you can start using the SDK in your Laravel application.

```php
use Upstash\Vector\Laravel\Facades\Vector;
use Upstash\Vector\VectorUpsert;
use Upstash\Vector\VectorQuery;

Vector::upsertMany([
  new VectorUpsert(
    id: 'id-1',
    vector: [0.1, 0.2],
    metadata: ['metadata_field' => 'metadata_value1']
  ),
  new VectorUpsert(
    id: 'id-2',
    vector: [0.3, 0.4],
    metadata: ['metadata_field' => 'metadata_value2']
  ),
]);

$results = Vector::query(new VectorQuery(vector: [ 0.6, 0.9 ], topK: 10));
 
// ...
```

### Closing Thoughts & Future

We're excited to see the growth of Upstash Vector and what the PHP ecosystem will build with it!

So my question for you is...

*What will you build?*
