#### Markprompt's Technical Stack: Leveraging Upstash for Multiple Use Cases

Our stack is: TypeScript, Effect, Vercel, Supabase and Upstash. Upstash serves us on multiple fronts: agent memory, general data caching layer and rate limiting.

Upstash makes it incredibly easy to drop in a key value store and a rate limiter in our code base.
