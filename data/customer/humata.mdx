### Meet Humata:

Humata is an AI-powered platform that allows you to connect your entire knowledge base to summarize information, compare files, and get answers quickly. With over 5 million users, Humata received a $3.5 million seed investment from Google's Gradient Ventures.

### An AI company that scales to millions with Upstash:

With hundreds or thousands of documents, videos, and various media types, Humata generates summaries and text embeddings to power a knowledge answer engine. Upstash QStash has been invaluable for queuing the numerous file uploads, guaranteeing the delivery of millions of requests to OpenAI, and supporting our high traffic loads.

Before QStash, we sent requests directly to OpenAI. We faced issues such as hitting OpenAI token limits, instability in response delivery, and challenges in controlling the data flow we needed to send. If one request for a file failed, the entire file would fail.

Since we had hundreds of requests per file we ingested, reliability in these requests was crucial for us. Since our application is hosted on Vercel and is running via a serverless architecture we don't have longing running servers and we struggled to find a service that would integrate nicely into our stack.

### After QStash, Humata achieved higher reliability with a serverless architecture

Initially, we struggled with upload reliability at around 90%, but after dedicating more energy to this issue with the help of Upstash, we have achieved over 99.9% upload reliability. Additionally, new features we've developed, such as importing the knowledge base of an entire website, have become much simpler for our team.
