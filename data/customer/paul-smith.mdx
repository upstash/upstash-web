### How Paul Smith Tapped Upstash to Power a Headless Fashion Frontend

We use Vercel with Nuxt, where Upstash integrates directly so the frontend can
securely query Redis without needing a middleware layer.

On the backend, our services also read and write to Upstash, handling cache
invalidation and updates triggered by webhooks across multiple systems.

This setup ensures consistent, low-latency data access across the stack.

### Switch to Upstash

We previously managed Redis on our own servers, but this approach was not
cloud-agnostic and created friction for our headless architecture.

Transitioning to Upstash solved these issues: its global availability, low-latency
performance, and serverless flexibility aligned perfectly with our distributed
systems, while reducing operational overhead and improving scalability.
