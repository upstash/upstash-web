We’re Gail the financial services AI. We help you sell more, serve customers 24/7, and give your team their own expert to answer faster, spot opportunities, and stay compliant. We communicate with your customers with conversational AI over several mediums including phone and texting and can integrate into your systems to keep things in sync.

### Gail's Technical Stack

1. Frontend: NextJS
2. Backend: C# .NET
3. Cache: Upstash Redis
4. Cron jobs: Upstash QStash


We used Upstash first as a cache for the UI to handle requests faster but quickly grew to need cache to allow Gail to be quick and reliable both for our customers and our customers’ customers.

We also love QStash and have that running checks to make sure our customers accounts are onboarded quickly with all the compliance required for telephony.

Our conversational AI handles millions of calls and text messages a day and we need our cache to be consistently fast to truly converse well.

### Gail With Upstash

We’re a new product from the ground up. Some of the team used a separate Redis instance when we first started but found having things in one central location to be optimal.
