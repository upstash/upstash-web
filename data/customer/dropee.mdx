Dropee started as a marketing tool SaaS, and in 2024 we pivoted to the Telegram gaming industry. Since then, we've attracted more than 12M players. Our mission is to bring fun and rewarding games into Telegram.

#### Dropee's Technical Stack: Where Upstash fits in

We run on Cloudflare Workers and CockroachDB. Upstash is used from our API mainly to store heavily read data.

- Redis: Caching for heavily read data, leaderboards, and a locking system
- QStash: Schedules and background task orchestration

#### Switch to Upstash

In our previous application we used AWS ElastiCache, but since that wasn't possible with Cloudflare Workers we switched to Upstash Redis.
