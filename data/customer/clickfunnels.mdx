From lead generation to product sales, ClickFunnels fuels global entrepreneurial
growth and Upstash delivers the fast, reliable data backbone it relies on.

### Edge-First Architecture with Upstash

At ClickFunnels, we run a large scale platform that powers sales funnels for
entrepreneurs all over the world. 

Our architecture leans heavily on Cloudflare Workers at the edge, and thatâ€™s
where Upstash has been a game-changer. Because they provide Redis over HTTP, it
fits perfectly with our edge-first model.

### Partnership Beyond Technology

We use Redis to cache customer data and serve it instantly, which has made our
customer facing application faster and more reliable. What really stands out,
beyond the technology, is the partnership.

We didn't have a Redis solution that could work this way before Upstash, and
since adopting it, we've not only improved performance and scalability but also
gained peace of mind. Their support team has been incredibly proactive and
always willing to collaborate.
