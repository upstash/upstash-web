Streamlined is an analytics and automation platform built on top of HighLevel CRM. We sync contacts, conversations, tasks, and pipeline data at scale — all through external APIs with strict rate limits of **200,000 requests per account per day**.

As the platform grew, the challenge wasn’t running background jobs. It was **coordinating real-time webhooks, long-running syncs, and bulk operations safely** while staying under rate limits, controlling costs, and scaling predictably.

#### Streamlined’s Technical Stack: Where Upstash fits in

Streamlined runs across multiple serverless runtimes, choosing compute based on the workload rather than the workflow engine.

Upstash acts as the **coordination layer** across all asynchronous work, ensuring every job respects external API limits — regardless of where it runs.

#### Switching to Upstash Workflow and QStash

Before choosing Upstash, Streamlined evaluated several workflow platforms, including Trigger.dev, Inngest, Cloudflare Workflows, and custom concurrency systems built with Durable Objects. Each fell short in one critical area: **shared flow control across different types of work**.

With Upstash, Streamlined was able to:
- Remove hard concurrency ceilings imposed by workflow platforms
- Coordinate real-time webhooks, background jobs, and bulk syncs under the same rate limits
- Run compute where it made sense without being locked into a single runtime

The impact was immediate. At peak usage, workflow-related compute costs dropped from **~$1,500/month to ~$40/month**, while overall workload increased by nearly **10×**.

Today, Streamlined scales predictably with real usage, not platform-imposed limits. Upstash handles the hard problems of flow control, durability, and coordination, letting the team focus on building product instead of infrastructure.
