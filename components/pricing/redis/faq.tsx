        <AccordionContent>
          With the Pay As you go plan, you can set a maximum monthly budget for
          your database so that you won't be charged beyond this chosen limit.
          We'll keep you informed by sending email notifications once you reach
          70% and 90% of your monthly budget. This notifications will let you
          either adjust your budget limit or upgrade to the Pro tier. Note that
          if your usage exceeds your monthly budget cap, your database will be
          rate limited and your cost will not exceed your chosen budget limit.

          Are read and write commands same price?
        </AccordionTrigger>
        <AccordionContent>
          Yes. But for Global databases, the write commands are replicated to
          all read regions in addition to primary region. Replications (write
          operations) are also counted as commands. For example, if you have 1
          primary 1 read region, 100K writes will cost $0.4 ($0.2 x 2)

        <AccordionTrigger>How is the storage cost calculated?</AccordionTrigger>
        <AccordionContent>
          The storage cost is charged at a rate of $0.25 per GB total storage.
          Total storage is determined by adding up the storage at all replicas
          and regions. Even if you do not access your data, we have to keep it
          persistent in Cloud Providerâ€™s block storage (eg AWS EBS, S3) for
          durability. To calculate the total storage cost, we take daily average
          of your data size and multiply with $0.25 at the end of the month. For
          instance, if you have 1 GB data in your database throughout month, you
          will pay $0.25. If you are using your database as a cache; then it is
          a good practice to set a timeout (EXPIRE) for your keys to minimize
          the cost.
