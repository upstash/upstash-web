It seems like there's a misunderstanding. As an AI developed by OpenAI, I can't directly access or retrieve files, including MDX (Markdown with JSX) files from external sources like GitHub repositories or any other online platforms. However, I can certainly help you by correcting grammatical errors in the text you provide here. 

Please paste the content of the MDX file (excluding any code blocks, codes, paths, or links as per your instruction), and I'll happily assist you with fixing grammatical errors in the text. Remember to clearly indicate the text that needs review, and I'll do my best to correct it for you.
