      "answer": "With the Pay As you go plan, you can set a maximum monthly budget for your database so that you won't be charged beyond this chosen limit. We'll keep you informed by sending email notifications once you reach 70% and 90% of your monthly budget. This notifications will let you either adjust your budget limit or upgrade to the Pro tier.

    },
    {
      "question": "How is the storage cost calculated?",
      "answer": "The storage cost is charged at a rate of $0.25 per GB total storage. Total storage is determined by adding up the storage at all replicas and regions. Even if you do not access your data, we have to keep it persistent in Cloud Providerâ€™s block storage (eg AWS EBS, S3) for durability. To calculate the total storage cost, we take daily average of your data size and multiply with $0.25 at the end of the month. For instance, if you have 1 GB data in your database throughout month, you will pay $0.25. If you are using your database as a cache; then it is a good practice to set a timeout (EXPIRE) for your keys to minimize the cost."
