    {
      "question": "How is the storage cost calculated?",
      "answer": "The storage cost is charged at a rate of $0.25 per GB total storage. Total storage is determined by adding up the storage at all replicas and regions. Even if you do not access your data, we have to keep it persistent in Cloud Provider’s block storage (eg AWS EBS, S3) for durability. To calculate the total storage cost, we take daily average of your data size and multiply with $0.25 at the end of the month. For instance, if you have 1 GB data in your database throughout month, you will pay $0.25. If you are using your database as a cache; then it is a good practice to set a timeout (EXPIRE) for your keys to minimize the cost."
